00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
There has always been
a process of displacement in this city,

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.770
of a spatial displacement
away from the elite.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.020
Only the police
gets closer to the poor.

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:17.370
Downtown, for example, the slums,
black people's dwellings,

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.820
are places which have always had
lots of issues with the police.

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.050
The slums have always been
pushed out, right?

7
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.770
Today, in the outskirts of the city...

8
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.800
we can see that
violence is never ceasing,

9
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.680
and cultural centers, libraries,
are never being established.

10
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.680
This project is still ongoing...

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.740
the project for the extermination
of a population is still ongoing.
