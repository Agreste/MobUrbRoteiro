Unlike many historians, I'll not
slag off the Catholic Church

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.250
telling you that it imposed
a culture and a religiosity.

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.480
I'll not state the obvious, right?
Of course it imposed many things.

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.220
But I have to tell you that before
this cathedral, this place was the

Mas também não posso deixar de dizer
que hoje onde é a catedral era o Beco do Mosquito.

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.710
"Mosquito Alley." There was batucada,
samba. They've built the cathedral on it.

6
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.170
Nearby, there was a segregated
church for blacks, where today the

7
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.170
stock exchange is. Quinze de
Novembro St. wasn't called so.

8
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.280
It was called Nossa Senhora do
Rosário dos Homens Pretos.

9
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.940
The street was destroyed by
Antonio da Silva Prado, who

10
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.420
named the Square after himself, and
built that stock exchange building.

11
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.050
After that, people pulled together
and build the Rosário do Paissandu

12
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.110
church. Have you ever
been to Paissandu?

13
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.540
There are beggars and
lower-class people

14
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.540
on the surroundings
of this church, right?
