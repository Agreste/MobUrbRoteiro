00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.770
And now, have you heard? Sao Paulo's
City Council is closing the stands

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.000
that used to be under the overpasses
serving as facilities for people

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.680
living on the streets.

4
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.340
Places where they could shower,
eat, change and wash their clothes...

5
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.650
Clearly, this is an endeavor

6
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.340
to wipe that people,
that population out

7
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.910
of the city centre.

8
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.250
Now, people who had a place
to shower before, don't have it

9
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.400
anymore; who had means to become
waste pickers and make some money

10
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.110
out of it, they
can't do it anymore.

11
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.570
Anything offered to those people
from now on will be useful to them.

12
00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.200
It's perverse and cruel to reduce
things that were already scarce

13
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.800
to them. This is proper
of neoliberalism, isn't it?

14
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.280
The precariousness, the predicament,
putting pressure on people.

15
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.770
The steady endeavor to make
people's lives more and more

16
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.340
unbearable, and so the
proposed solutions for them

17
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.710
to become consumers are more and
more sparing and they'll be

18
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.110
more and more willing to give their
lives to their last drop of blood

19
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.570
in order to get by.

20
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.600
For the 2007 project, a field research
has been made identifying homeless

21
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.650
people, sex professionals,
street vendors and so on.

22
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.110
In 2013 there were none identified,
so I asked the architect,

23
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.220
"You've done the same project
for the same area using the same

24
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.400
methodology. How come you haven't
identified the same population?"

25
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.910
cause the social situation
hasn't changed, right?

26
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.140
So she said, "I can judge people
by their clothes." I'm serious!

27
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.400
Obviously with, again,
such a perverse, low

28
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.370
argument as such,
it's impossible to think that

29
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.510
those people will be considered
at any level of the project.

30
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.620
- The project clearly don't
include anything in regard to

31
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.620
those people, does it?

32
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.600
Well, it includes a storage place.

33
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.740
From the Municipal Social
Welfare Department.

34
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.450
Which is important,
a storage place.
