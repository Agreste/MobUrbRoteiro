00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.310
- I wanted to ask you about the
expression "revitalization", used

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.540
for the AnhangabaÃº Valley project...
- As if there's no life there.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.820
Exactly, right. Actually,
this word's fallen into disuse,

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.340
maybe you haven't noticed,
but the current local government

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.000
does not talk
about revitalization.

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.680
this is what they claim: "to say
'revitalize' is to say there's

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.970
no life there now and we know
there's life in the city centre."

8
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.400
They use critical discourse
in a fucking horrible way.

9
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.250
It's brutal. So this word
is not used anymore.

10
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.540
At least not in the local
government official speeches.

11
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.250
The term "requalification"
is also not very used.

12
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.480
What's being used
right now is "resignification."

13
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.250
They say, "we have to resignify
the city centre, its uses..."

14
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.340
and so on. And it's crazy to think
about it, because gentrification,

15
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.680
most of the time,

16
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.110
comes along with
a discourse to legitimate it,

17
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.400
which is necessary provided that,
obviously, the contradiction

18
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.400
of doing it only for the sake
of profit has to be kept out.

19
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.400
So, the discourse of
resignification is fundamental

20
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.000
because it's a way of
cleaning out a territory

21
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.050
without saying
it's being cleaned.

22
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.170
It's only being "resignified."
