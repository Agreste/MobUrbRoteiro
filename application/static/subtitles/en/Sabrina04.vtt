00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.170
Itaú Bank bought the flagship
of this project and donated it

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.880
to our City Council. But it's
actually a white elephant,

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.110
because Itaú has payed ‎€500,000 on
the project and the City Council

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.570
accepted it claiming that
"there wasn't enough cash on hand

5
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.110
and so, it would be wonderful
to take the project forward,"

6
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.310
something they wanted
and couldn't afford.

7
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.740
The City Council has already payed
2 million and 100 thousand reals

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.970
to an office in Curitiba to get
the project off the drawing board

9
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.370
because Itaú's donation was only
for the project of the Danish office

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.680
only the idea of the project, right?
Plus 200 million reals that will be

11
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.020
funded from public coffers for the
construction of reflecting mirrors,

12
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.450
cafes, kiosks... This project
actually dates back to 2007

13
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.050
and the one Itaú bought
is from 2013.

14
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.420
These projects include reflecting
pools in this area, cutting

15
00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.080
the Anhangabaú Valley from
the ending of the overpass up there.

16
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.050
There won't be any fountains,
cause they're not homeless-free.

17
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.110
Homeless take showers
in fountains.

18
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.110
That's why those ones are
turned off. So, like, fountains

19
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.820
are holes on the floor through
which water springs up and they

20
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.800
can be controlled. You
can turn it on and off.

21
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.510
You can turn only this
central area on, or only the sides,

22
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.310
or all of them together.

23
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.170
And so you can control where you
want people to walk through or not.

24
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.800
They want people to occupy
the edges of the Valley.

25
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.420
Besides, they want to build around
fifty commercial establishments.

26
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.200
There will be kiosks,
flower shops and all.

27
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.880
There are many bars and joints
over there, I don't know

28
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.800
if you've seen them. They want
to give them a fresh air.

29
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.140
It's like the kind of thing
that Coca-Cola and Skol do.

30
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.740
They go to a joint
in the outskirts

31
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.080
and set canopies

32
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.020
with the name of the place
and their brands on it.

33
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.400
Over there, where
the Prestes Maia Bazaar is,

34
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.800
they're proposing to build
an underground shopping mall.

35
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.970
They also intend to reshape

36
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.340
the landscaping.
I wouldn't know exactly what

37
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.820
this reshaping would be like,
but I know in involves other

38
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.970
kinds of trees and shading trees.

39
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.820
More of a recreational environment,
that kind of stuff...

40
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.940
They want to recover the water
as an architectural element of

41
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.050
the Anhangabaú Valley,
because it has once been a river.

42
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.370
I mean, it's an underground
channeled river.

43
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.200
It's fucking channeled. And that's
why we have historical floods here

44
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.200
since around 1950s, 1960s...

45
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.620
There are pictures.

46
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.400
What they don't tell us is that
the project includes a reduction

47
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.140
of almost 2,000 square meters
of permeable surface area,

48
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.480
that is, they want to recover
the water as an element by

49
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.850
building reflecting pools in times
of critical water shortage that

50
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.770
will make the soil of one of
the most impermeable soils

51
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.050
of the region
even more impermeable.

52
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.020
It's like,
one mistake after another.
