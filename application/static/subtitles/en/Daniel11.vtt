00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
It's hard to talk
about the movement and

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.710
the struggle for housing and about
how it is to live in a squat,

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.820
cause, like... hundreds of things.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.880
It's not an easy fight.

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.650
The people living here
don't have a choice.

6
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.000
It's either this or they go back
to their previous living conditions.

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.280
Take me, for example,

8
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.880
like, I'm single,

9
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.620
I have no responsibility
to any children

10
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.740
and it's already hard for me,
you know? Then imagine how it is

11
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.480
for a family with
three, four children

12
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.200
who come to struggle for a
living and it's not certain that

13
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.220
they'll be settled, or that
they'll get a job, or that

14
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.880
there will be vacancies for
their children in public schools.

15
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.570
Everything is uncertain, you know?
Not to mention the...

16
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.850
I wouldn't say fear, but maybe
an uneasiness about a possible

17
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.710
eviction action and then having
to leave on the very next day.

18
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.370
Everything is very uncertain and
you actually have to take risks.

19
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.740
It's not easy. And in the families
here, people are mostly women,

20
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.540
strong women. I think if I had to
choose an image to represent

21
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.250
the squat it would be the image
of a woman. Not of a woman like

22
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.710
the one who guided French people,
but like a real woman, you know?

23
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.910
A strong, decided woman

24
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.250
who provides for her family
and fights for what she believes

25
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.170
so to have better
life conditions.

26
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.000
Cause it's not easy.

27
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.600
These people have
a high social vulnerability

28
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.600
and they really
don't have a choice.

29
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.710
A court verdict
of an eviction action

30
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.880
doesn't consider the human side,
does it? The humanization needed.

31
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.680
Human beings as they are won't think
of these matters and will decide

32
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.140
to put almost 240
families out on the streets

33
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.400
or in their previous life
conditions, which were far worse

34
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.680
than any low-cost housing or
squat. A squat lacks many things,

35
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:38.020
but it's a place that people have
transformed and given meaning to,

36
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.800
where they've created
dignified conditions.
