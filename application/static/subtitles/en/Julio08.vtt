00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.340
Here was the reception,

2
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.420
where they would store the goods.

3
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.080
When people arrived,
they'd take notes in a book,

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.000
"I am traveling to town with this
many sacks of rice, slaves..."

5
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.910
It was like the clerk office
of the house.

6
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.140
And people from the troops
were not allowed in there.

7
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.540
It was only for the family.

8
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.340
And that other room over there

9
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.910
was the dining hall.
Let's go there.

10
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.540
- JÃºlio, is that
a picture of Luiz Gama?

11
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.940
- Yes, it is. Luiz Gama
was the first black lawyer

12
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.970
in the history of Brazil.

13
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.650
He represented more than 500 slaves
in court for their liberation

14
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.400
and he won all of them.

15
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.570
So, here was the dining hall
where the troops would hang out.

16
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.880
It's the only room
leading to the yard

17
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.880
Let me open the door
here so you can see it.

18
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.710
The troops would take
some time and rest there.

19
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.800
Their donkeys, horses
and goods would all stay

20
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.480
over there, before they
departed to the headquarters

21
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.710
of Santo Amaro or
of Piratininga village.

22
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.710
Obviously, today this room
hosts this exhibition

23
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:59.620
of Luiz Gama's social life

24
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.220
as a journalist, poet, lawyer...
