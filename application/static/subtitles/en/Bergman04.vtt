00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.940
The slave didn't...

2
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.420
represent this...

3
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.880
this nobility, this will to be big.

4
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.650
For the elite, the slave was...
he was a thing, right?

5
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.740
In the post-abolition-period,
the black continued to be a thing.

6
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.220
So, for the elite

7
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.650
the blacks
were not a part of that will.

8
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.480
But then, what is to be done with
all the black people in the country?

9
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.200
With the mass of black people,
which is also in this state?

10
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.880
So the first scholars have claimed:

11
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.080
"what if we unite two races?"

12
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.510
"The inferior race, blacks,
with the superior race,

13
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.340
and so we have a middle ground." The
intermarriage, a whitening policy.

14
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.370
"Let's make it whiter," right?
"Let's interbreed."

15
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.850
Those policies were very supported

16
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.020
by Nina Rodrigues' studies on
craniometry, criminology...

17
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.940
We also have a "Status Juridicus"

18
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.570
guided by those studies.

19
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.880
The black is classified as a
suspect type, as a criminal type

20
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.250
on the basis of those studies.

21
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.220
And the immigrant is the worker.

22
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.880
So along with
this whitening policy,

23
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.140
beyond the elite's interests

24
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.170
in forming a population that

25
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.170
has to be in a certain
way they want it to be,

26
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.280
we have the white immigrant
as the worker, as the one who conquers.

27
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.250
So, the praise goes to the bandeirante,
the conqueror, the white worker...

28
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.250
...and the black is the criminal.

29
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.220
The black is criminalized all the time.

30
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.650
and this criminalization
is strongly supported

31
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.400
by academic studies,
which reinforce all this process.

32
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.600
In Brazil, we have
Euclides da Cunha, Oliveira Viana,

33
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:48.140
scholars who reinforce
this inferiority aspect,

34
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.650
and this criminalization logic.

35
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:59.400
They bring this whitening process
as the way to "civilize" the country,

36
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.140
specially here, in this state. We
can see it's a governmental project.
