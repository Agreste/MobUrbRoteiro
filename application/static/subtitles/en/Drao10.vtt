00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.710
The downtown area
have always been an issue.

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.970
After the economical growth,

3
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.050
people have started to talk
about the outmigration process

4
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.510
to the outskirts of the city.

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.570
and they've forgotten
about the race matter

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.710
and the social movements
for housing, and focused on

7
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.340
the social class issue, which
is, of course, also important.

8
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.200
From 1950 to 1970, Sao Paulo
really started to grow.

9
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.570
And the same segregation
pattern still happens nowadays.

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.650
But not that focused in
the downtown area anymore, right?

11
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.450
But also in the outskirts,
where the folks who left downtown

12
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.250
went to, together with people
from other parts of Brazil.

13
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.250
They swell the city's population and
then start to reside in the outskirts...

14
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.940
And from the outskirts, there's
nowhere else to escape to.

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.540
The way out
is killing people, right?

16
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.650
- Until this way out
gets "also occupied"

17
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.880
- Yes, until it gets
equally occupied, right?

18
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.020
- This is what's happening now
to the East Zone of Sao Paulo...

19
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.220
Exactly! And where's
all the people going to?

20
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.910
Maybe to the surrounding cities?

21
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.910
Maybe...

22
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.510
I don't know, Ferraz city,
Itapevi... the ABC region...

23
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.710
It's a complicated issue, isn't it?

24
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.370
But still, the downtown area
is a place to live.

25
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.280
The population resists and finds
alternative ways of living.

26
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.940
It's so funny. The Camanducaia
operation is very little spoken of.

27
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.510
Have you ever heard of it?

28
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.340
There were like 120 underaged...

30
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.510
If it were soul music...
we could even dance!
