I've read in an article from Folha,

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.510
Luciana Temer's opinion
about the street dwellers living

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.600
under Minhocão overpass.
It was in the time the bike paths

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.370
were being built there.
She said, like, "homeless people

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.800
can't stay here, this is
not a place for people to live,

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.680
the streets are not only
their property," meaning that

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.370
homeless privatize public space.
And this discourse has already

8
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.480
been delivered by other City Council
members. It's a perverse thought.

9
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.770
The City Council argues that street
dwellers privatize public space,

10
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.940
but then what does Itaú does? No,
it's not privatizing, it's giving

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:45.170
public space back to people. In the
moment Itaú buys a project and very

12
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.570
generously donate it to the city,
the City Council implements it.

13
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.480
This is also the kind of
self-improving discourse.

14
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.570
Vulnerable populations
always get screwed up.

15
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.880
They're the people in
the forefront of the battle,

16
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.910
always taking the first hit when
trying to stand for their rights,

17
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.000
which on the bottom line are
our rights as well. The difference

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.310
is that we still have conditions
to stand for our rights, while

19
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.650
vulnerable populations, most of
the time, can't. To say that

20
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.770
street dwellers privatize
public space is like...

21
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.170
I gotta take my hat off to the City
Council members if they're able

22
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.910
to promote such a discourse, cause
it's so brilliant, like, being able

23
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.770
of making people believe it and
repeat it. And people do repeat

24
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.220
the discourse of wanting
a city made for people.
