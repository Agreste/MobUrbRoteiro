00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
The University of Sao Paulo, USP,
was founded in 1933.

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.970
Then, the courses
were taught in French.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.910
So who could have the possibility
to study at USP in that time?

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.310
Could poor people and black people
study there? Could they speak French?

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:23.710
Of course not.
So we had an academic elite

6
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.200
who was responsible for
producing knowledge,

7
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.000
who shaped the historical
and scientific knowledge

8
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.680
and decided to exclude
the working class,

9
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.420
the blacks and
the women of their history.

10
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.400
So I believe one of our roles

11
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.880
is to discuss and debate

12
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.310
our history.

13
00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.280
We have to create efficient mechanisms
to disseminate new knowledge,

14
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.050
knowledge that is not
dictated by the elite.

15
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.420
We can't rely on knowledge that
was manipulated by the elite, right?

16
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.710
We're also talking about
an ideology here, right?

17
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.880
A dominant ideology that has developed
historical and scientific knowledge

18
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.880
in a biased way.

19
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.740
we have to find a way to also
create ideological mechanisms

20
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.110
to break this knowledge.

21
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.680
We want to have a history,
we want freedom.

22
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.200
We want a dignified, human life.
And to fight for a human life

23
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200
means to fight against
this mode of production.
