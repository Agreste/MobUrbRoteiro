00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880
We know gentrification
projects are being hidden,

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.570
disguised as museological-related
cultural preservation, so that

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.540
it seems to have
some public interest.

4
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:24.340
When someone proposes
to create a cultural center

5
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.050
for the sake of the city,
to return it to the city,

6
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.370
then it's very hard to counter
the things underlaying that interest.

7
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.940
And this is another story of a
gentrification process disguised

8
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.250
as official cultural institution.

9
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.680
"But why do you say so if there are
dwellers taking part in it?"

10
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.680
I'm not speaking for the dwellers.

11
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.020
I'm speaking for the city,
for a reflection about the city.

12
00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.910
You are using culture in a cynical way

13
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.650
to promote gentrification and
expulsion of people in places

14
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.800
where real estate market
speculation can be raised.

15
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.910
It's that simple! Done.
