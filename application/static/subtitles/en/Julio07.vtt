00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.420
This place has once
been a watershed area.

2
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.710
In the 18th c.,

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.850
there were rivers, creeks
and fountainheads all around here,

4
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.370
and since it's located on
the way from Santos to here,

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.200
they've built this jesuitic house.

6
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.820
All this delimitated area

7
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.970
indicates the part
listed as a historical site.

8
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.220
It can't be
refurbished or anything.

9
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.770
It has to be preserved the way it is.

10
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.340
Actually, all the space
is listed as a historical site,

11
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.970
but this delimitated area
is officially a preserved area.

12
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.280
Spring is coming now,

13
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.050
but we can't see
birds like we did before.

14
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.600
I mean, we do,

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.250
but not that much. They used
to come in flocks, scratching

16
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.600
and pecking at the ground.

17
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.200
They'd stay in the trees,
even though there are not

18
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.540
many fruit trees around here.
But they took hold, and today

19
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.540
there are few of them.

20
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.400
Some people who have been
working here for longer

21
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.110
tell us they've already seen monkeys
and other animals in the trees.

22
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.970
Unfortunately, things happen
at a very fast pace.

23
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.000
We used to see
so many birds around here

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.250
and now they've disappeared.
