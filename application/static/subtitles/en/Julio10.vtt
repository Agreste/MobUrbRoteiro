00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.200
It's been covered with concrete,

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.540
so there's no way we
can dig up the place

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.740
or ask for a proper
archeological excavation.

4
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.680
So history has been
interrupted here.

5
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.970
They've used cement bags,
quicklime, soil...

6
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.710
This was a column and there
were stairs going down from here.

7
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.000
They led to another room,

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.200
that way.

9
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.000
These are pretty modern
engineering techniques.

10
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.820
There's not one
single brick over there.

11
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.510
- It's made with those
masonry concrete blocks, right?

12
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.650
- Yes.

13
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.310
I keep imagining that

14
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.650
I'd want to hang something on the
wall, but when I tapped a nail in,

15
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.340
the concrete would crack

16
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.800
and fall apart.

17
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.110
- What do you think
there is underneath all of it?

18
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.800
- Yeah, I mean, I've kept an
eye on it when they started.

19
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.680
Every morning I'd come
and watch from over there.

20
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.800
But they've fenced the
surroundings.

21
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.970
Sometimes I'd watch the trucks
to see if I caught something weird,

22
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.970
but I didn't see anything.

23
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.510
And this is how it's done.
People come, start to dig places...

24
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.510
It's their property, I know.

25
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.510
But there's a history and

26
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.970
the properties are too close
to each other, one next to the other.

27
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.970
There could be
something weird about it.

28
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.280
Look! What's that?

29
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.280
The crane is hoisting something.

30
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.250
Those are the kind
of blocks they use.
