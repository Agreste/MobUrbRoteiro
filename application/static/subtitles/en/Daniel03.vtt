00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.710
In other times, peasants

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.220
were the ones capable of
making a revolution

3
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.310
or of, somehow, shaking up
the established systems.

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.450
Then the proletariat.

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.140
Then some other movements for
freedom, springs and so on.

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.000
And today I see movements
that could represent

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.540
this struggle for social
equality and rights.

8
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:37.280
I see a possibility of waving
the banner of social rights.

9
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.940
The thing is that these
movements are not united.

10
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.650
For example, the students movement
is not united with the housing

11
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.400
movements in any way,
nor with others.

12
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.450
The women's marches
are not all united.

13
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.020
I believe these movements

14
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.620
are capable of fighting for rights

15
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.110
because they're well-articulated.

16
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.170
They have a legal basis
and other kinds of principles.

17
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.910
That's why I believe this
movement I've been part of

18
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.050
is a movement of resistance,

19
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:25.570
because it deals directly
with families in need

20
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.510
and even teaches then,

21
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:35.000
shows them that they
can fight for their rights,

22
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.910
that there are ways to do that.

23
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.140
I think the dialogue with the
public sector, as well as

24
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.050
pressure on the public sector
are ways to fight for rights.

25
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.480
That's why I believe
that this movement

26
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.280
is a tool for doing politics.

27
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.680
This squat's had a cultural
center since its beginning.

28
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.170
Hundreds of people have come here
willing to make the difference

29
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.510
and do something for the cause.

30
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.080
And its door is always open

31
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.540
for anyone who wants to engage in
a cultural activity or get to know

32
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.000
the squat, which most of the people
do through the cultural center.

33
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.600
Some of them come to see how
the movement works and all that,

34
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.020
but the gateway is
the cultural center.

35
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.680
And when people come to a squat
and get to know about the

36
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.220
cultural center, they feel
more comfortable, you know?

37
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.570
So it's playing this
extraordinary role of

38
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.220
providing cultural activities
and interchanges of experience

39
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.080
in the squat,
and also of demystifying

40
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.910
what the media say, right?
