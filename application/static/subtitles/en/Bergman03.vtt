00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
The security force that preceded
our police force formation in 1831

2
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.820
had a bandeirante
brand: the "bandeirante militia".

3
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.850
There's an author who says
the bandeirante is the white civilizer man.

4
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.940
He represents that which
the white elite wants as a portrait

5
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.000
of Sao Paulo... And that's
a whitened portrait, isn't it?

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.970
We can't forget that this is
the period we're in right now,

7
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.570
we're in a process of
whitening this city more and more,

8
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.600
cause the immigrant is much more similar
to the bandeirante than the black.

9
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.280
And what explains that?
What is a possible answer to that?

10
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.650
The systematic criminalization of blacks

11
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.620
and the establishment of that city code,
which were always guided by the police laws.

12
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.280
So every time the state
establishes a public policy

13
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.020
it's related to the
code of police laws.

14
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.370
So public safety always
comes in the first place.

15
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.880
And then in the 19th century
there's been a growth of...

16
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.600
we have deaths data, right?
Blacks' disappearance data.
