00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.170
Katu Kanoni to you all.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.340
In our language, Katu Kanoni
means "Good afternoon".

3
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.170
I thank you all for being here today.
I am Binho Porã Tupinambá.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.220
I am brother of
Cacique Gildo and Cacique Fia.

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.650
There are two brothers who
are caciques in our village.

6
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.200
We are here in this fight.

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.140
People say Indians don't exist,
but my grandfather was a centenarian,

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.880
it's been more than 40 years
since he's passed away. It's been

9
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:38.850
more than 100 years, around 150 since
my grandparents and great-grandparents

10
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.570
lived in those villages. When we
were expelled from our village,

11
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.400
we went back to Ilhéus, to
my origins in the state of Bahia.

12
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.020
And we reclaimed our lands
because that is our place,

13
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.250
where we live with what my
mother has nurtured...

14
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.600
Today there's not enough time
for us to live there. We don't

15
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.680
have enough time to live because
all that was ours that we had...

16
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.310
beans, mango, jackfruits... it's
destroyed, all of our nature only

17
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.000
to plant manga. Manga is what
I call cattle pasture.

18
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.080
Where an ox has 100 hectares
of land, no good for people...

19
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.600
No good for
a lot of people, right?

20
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.770
An ox has more land than 100, 200,
100, even 1000 families.

21
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.680
So we're reclaiming our lands.

22
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.000
we will plant and we will make
a living of our lands again.

23
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.510
But today we're not
gonna make it, right, Josa?

24
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.910
Today we're not gonna make it,
but we have grandchildren,

25
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.600
we'll plant our coffee, our mangos,
jackfruit, cassava, everything...

26
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.400
our rice and our beans,
and we will make it.

27
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.540
Now, with your support,

28
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.820
because without your support
we won't make it. Thank you very much.
