00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340
When we talk about city, this
is the city we talk about.

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.970
We'll see some city plans...

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.200
You'll see that in the old plans,
the city ended at Penha neighbourhood.

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.480
Until the 20th c., Sao Paulo
ended at the Penha neighbourhood.

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.170
In here, at the Santana neighbourhood
and I think at Pinheiros in here.

6
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.850
The city we hear of doesn't extend
to Sao Miguel, Guarulhos districs,

7
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.420
to the outskirts,

8
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.540
where a rejected population dwells.

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.650
The Tamanduateí river is
like a Berlin Wall

10
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.420
that divides the city of
the poor and the city of the rich.

11
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.600
The Higienópolis neighbourhood. It
literally means "City of Hygiene."

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.110
The Cidade Jardim, "Garden City."
Morumbi, Alto da Lapa...

13
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.770
you'll see, all of those are planned
to be away from the rivers,

14
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.770
where the poor live.
