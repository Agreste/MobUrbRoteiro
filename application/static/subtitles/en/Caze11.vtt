00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
We have to walk fast
through Sé Square, alright?

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.710
Because our relatives here don't
always live of righteous jobs.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.940
So, this is the building
I'm talking about.

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.170
The former Sé Cathedral was here.

5
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.370
The current one
is more to the right.

6
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.050
This building represents something
else. There's the power issue

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.680
to be considered. This architecture
dates back to the 40's, 50's.

8
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.540
The references here are not
London and Paris any longer.

9
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.000
The reference now comes from
the Unites States of America.

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.400
After the first World War,
which took place in Europe,

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.910
the USA strived as a big
economic superpower

12
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.000
and became a cultural
reference to most other countries.

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.220
And Brazil is a big sucker
of such structure,

14
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.770
if you can forgive me for the word.

15
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.880
That movie "Planet of the Apes",
when he returns to the spacecraft

16
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.400
from Earth, to a structure

17
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.680
which is just like
the American Capitol.

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.880
So, you can think of three
things simultaneously:

19
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.770
how ridicule is the American elite
who wants to be the new Rome,

20
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.850
and try to mimic the antique
Roman Empire, and how ridicule

21
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.510
is our elite, for trying to mimic
this other elite, the American.

22
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.540
It's luxury coming out of luxury.

23
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.140
My mother used to say,
"the richer, the more ridicule."

24
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.080
And that's it. I think it's
actually pretty ugly, isn't it?

25
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.250
It looks like a tomb. No, not
a tomb... where do we bury...

26
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.540
- A sarcophagus?
- Yes.

27
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.770
Because, look, it's made of a very
expensive material. By the way,

28
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.600
that is the Quinze de Novembro
St. to your right,

29
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.000
where the Rosário dos Homens
Pretos Church once was. As the

30
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.800
writer João Monteiro says in
the book "Blacks of the Earth",

31
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.800
the Indian is also black under the
eyes of the Portuguese, right?
