00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.400
Do you wanna wait
for the next parade or not?

2
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.340
Cause I don't think
it's coming this way...

3
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.570
So, several kinds of segregation
against immigrants as well, look:

4
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.820
"say no to discrimination!"

6
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.170
They have joined the immigrants.
This is so nice.

7
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.050
At least, misfortune
united everybody.

8
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.850
This is very interesting.
Here we have

9
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:32.140
an attempt to unite fronts
between immigrants and people of

10
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.850
Afro-Brazilian temples. Very interesting.
These are two processes of discrimination.

11
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.280
The people of
Afro-Brazilian temples

12
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.420
are here against
religious intolerance.

13
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.420
In this year of 2015,
almost 15 Afro-Brazilian temples

14
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.480
have been burned down
in different parts of Brazil

15
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.910
due to religious intolerance.

16
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.280
And here we see people united
against discrimination in a single act.

17
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.880
We see foreign immigrants
and {\i1}povo de santo{\10}.

18
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.370
This is very interesting.
Resistance is non-stop, isn't it?

19
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.340
It's lingering. The struggle
is not segregated.

20
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.340
That's it, see? Crazy.
Even with all segregation...

21
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.220
There's a possibility
of uniting in struggle.

22
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.740
This is very interesting!

23
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.740
It's worth mentioning that people
of Afro-Brazilian temples

24
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.510
in Sao Paulo still suffer
a lot with segregation

25
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.080
and religious intolerance nowadays.

26
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.770
- Mother, there used to be many
temples in the Peruche region

27
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.020
in the Casa Verde
neighborhood before, right?

28
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.080
- Yes. But it still does.
There are some old ones...

29
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.140
{\i1}Lá em casa{\i0}, {\i1}A Villa{\i0}
are still there...

30
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.020
- Even with all the transformation of
the neighborhood, people resisted, right?

31
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.740
- Oh, yes. We did it because
we were there in the first place.

32
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.480
The {\i1}axé{\i0} was planted
there. And so the resistance.

33
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.970
What we usually say is that we
inherited our ancestral's resistance.

34
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.140
- {\i1}Axé{\i0}!

35
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.110
- We were talking today about
the Rosário brotherhood.

36
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.800
- Yes, it's also
a resistance movement.

37
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.340
- A strong resistance, right?

38
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.170
- My brother is a member of it,
he's a Roman Catholic!
