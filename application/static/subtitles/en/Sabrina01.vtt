00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
I don't know, I mean...

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.480
Many times people ask me,
"what's the difference between

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:15.480
Kassab's and Haddad's policies?"

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.480
Deep down, the main actors
of the city are the same:

5
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.770
campaign financiers. Itaú Bank,
Porto Seguro insurance company,

6
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.510
the same actors. But Haddad's
and Kassab's modus operandi

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.850
are completely different.

8
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.650
Kassab had the discourse of hatred.

9
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.880
"Oh, Crackland, abusive
operations," and all that shit.

10
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.620
And Haddad is more about
a discourse of the dream.

11
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.170
Of rehabilitating the city
back to the people.

12
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.680
Everyone wants the city back,
it's been taken by cars, big

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.680
buildings and etcetera.

14
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.050
And that reaches many people.
Even upper-classes want to have

15
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.910
a city for people,
even the elite wants it.

16
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.340
And so does the poor,
but the way each of them

17
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.280
want it to be
is completely different.

18
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.140
And who is capable of
claiming for this city?

19
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.680
Who has the tools, the conditions
to build this city they want?

20
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.340
The middle-class.

21
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.820
I mean, Haddad speaks
specifically to the middle-classes

22
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.620
with his projects of bike paths,
the revitalization of the

23
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.400
Anhangabaú valley,
of street theatre and cinemas...

24
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.770
Those are not bad things.

25
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.650
Bike path? Cool! Street cinema?
Cool! But at what costs?

26
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.420
What are the alliances implied
in order to deploy those things?

27
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.050
It's a crazy thing. Like...
It works, huh?

29
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.910
I think Haddad will be able to
do what he wants, if he can...

30
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.600
he'll implement something
which Kassab couldn't do.
