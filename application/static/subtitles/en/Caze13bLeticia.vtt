00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.110
My name is Letícia.

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.650
I was born and raised
here in Sao Paulo.

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:14.680
Until some time ago, before
I met Casé, I didn't know

4
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.680
I was Indian.
From his point of view,

5
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.420
indigenous people leave
their land because of

6
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.680
expulsion or drought,
and escape to Sao Paulo

7
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.510
as a northeastern immigrant.

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.880
From this view I've started
to build my family tree

9
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.570
and I've realized my indigenous
bonds were really close.

10
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.820
I've found out my
great-grandparent is an Indian

11
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.940
and my grandmother, daughter of
Indians, and Indian herself too.

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.050
So if my grandmother is Indian,
so is my mother, and therefore,

13
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.680
so am I.

14
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.020
So from thereon I've
started to identify myself

15
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.250
and to feel more empowered.

16
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.110
I also could save
my family from ethnocide.

17
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.450
I can't really identify
all of the members, since

18
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.310
my great-great-grandparent
was held captive

19
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.340
and it's hard
to recognize his territory.

20
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.850
But I've been lucky enough
to find these peoples who

21
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.280
provided me shelter, the Tupinambá
and Mura, and they've taught me

22
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.250
how strong is the power of
culture, for bringing you here

23
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.850
to get to know us, to be with us,

24
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.600
and to give us all
of your attention. I thank you all.
