00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.880
Well, I'll follow up with this.

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.710
For those who don't know me,
my name is Casé Angatu, I'm indigenous

3
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.140
and I live in Olivença with the
Tupinambás who are fighting for land.

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.020
Also here with us today is
Yacui, from the Olho D'água community.

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.200
Here with us today is Bacurau Josa,
who is from Olho D'água community.

6
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.140
Also Binho is here,
Binho Imporã, and I, Casé

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.110
and we're from the
Guarani Taba-Atã village.

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.140
And so, we will try to
portrait the story

9
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.340
of this city.

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.940
So this is what we're going to do:

11
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.450
we're going to enter the clerical
museum and walk to the maps room

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.480
in the clerical museum, which is
up there and then straight to the back

13
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.820
we'll perceive
this dynamic of the plateau.

14
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.220
And then we come back here.
It costs four reals, alright?

15
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.820
It's nice if you spare some
change to help the attendant there.

16
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.340
So four reals. You'll have to leave
your bags there, there's a place for it.

17
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.970
You can't film or record in there.

18
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.220
Inside the museum, you can't
film nor record anything.

19
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.220
- Not even take pictures?

20
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.850
Not even take pictures, not inside
the museum, only outside, alright?
