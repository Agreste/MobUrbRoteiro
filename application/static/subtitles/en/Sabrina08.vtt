00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
Degradation processes,
in general,

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.510
are not, like, formed by

3
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.770
a spontaneous generation process.

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.710
A necessary condition for
gentrification to happen

5
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.650
is abandonment. People
supporting the financial capital,

6
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.650
like governors and big owners,
calculate what's going to be

7
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.310
more profitable some years from
now and what's not, and so they

8
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.000
allow their properties, sometimes
an entire region of the city

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.850
to degradate. They abandon it.

10
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.540
How they do it? They
stop paying property taxes

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.710
and use the saved money

12
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.600
to refurbish those places

13
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.880
and to foster
a gentrification process,

14
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.110
a renewal of those areas.

15
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.400
The capital invested
to refurbish an area

16
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.480
is the same capital
that degraded it.

17
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.650
Because capital flows
from those places

18
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.480
to more profitable places.

19
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.200
I believe that's what happened,
for example, when an emptying

20
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.080
of the city centre
took place in the 40's and 50's.

21
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.650
The number of abandoned buildings
we can find around here

22
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.940
with huge property tax debts,
impossible to pay, is enormous.

23
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.170
This is literally
a speculative abandonment.
