00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.200
Look! Traces of old times...

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.110
The tramway.

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.970
Crazy all this things about Sao
Paulo. It's a very changeable city.

4
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.800
We keep loosing track of history.

5
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.740
If we don't make an effort to get
to know our history all the time

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.800
we're consumed by... this knocking
down, building, rebuilding... reshaping

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:35.220
arranging, cleansing the environment,
expelling, segregating, killing!

8
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.280
The black population that
once lived in here, as well as others

9
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.510
have suffered with a more perverse,
increased segregation than people

10
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.510
from other places.

11
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.510
I don't mean to say that it wasn't
perverse in other places as well.

12
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm not going to start
ranking these processes.

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.710
but I believe that in Sao Paulo, this
process of segregation's been increased

14
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.140
and more violent.

15
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.650
And we still see it nowadays, right?

16
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:16.250
Most of the racist, homophobic
movements we see today

17
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.970
are from Sao Paulo.
They're Nazi groups.

18
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.170
In Sao Paulo, this is
very complicated, very serious.

19
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.250
And here at Chá Overpass, look.

20
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.220
In the 1980s, Chá Overpass
was a place full of card readers,

21
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.420
cowrie shell readers,

22
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.600
people selling herbs...

23
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.080
And today there're just a few
resistants left, look.

24
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.600
Very few left...
