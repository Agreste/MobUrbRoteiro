00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Slave to love, nursing
those from others born,

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.620
And like the kind,
self-vulning pelican,

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.250
Selflessly, to her Land
her breast she tore.

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.280
Verses by Ciro Costa.

5
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.940
It was mainly due to the outlets
left by the Catholic Church

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.940
and through the brotherhoods

7
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.020
that the black population could
have a minimal bond to society.

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.910
Important bonds, though, right?

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.510
That's why the black brotherhoods

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.510
have always had mysteries.

11
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.110
We know that there's always some
African-originated practice in

12
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.770
a black brotherhood. It's never
a catholic only brotherhood.

13
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.050
It always has something referring
to religions of African descent.

14
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.910
And the religions of African descent
have always respected the practices

15
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.170
in the brotherhood. Those bonds
were not only made in Sao Paulo.

16
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.480
For example, in the state of Bahia,
the Da Boa Morte Brotherhood was

17
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.480
bonded to Afro-Brazilian
temples of mainly Gege origins.

18
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.250
It's not different in Sao Paulo.
Many Afro-Brazilian temples

19
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.080
of Sao Paulo offer masses
of Thanksgiving here.

20
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.450
Specially here, by
the MÃ£e Preta statue...

21
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.820
which is a pretty questionable
symbol, isn't it?

22
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.140
It's related to the idea of
the motherly black woman,

23
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.510
still seen as a wet nurse.

24
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.710
Although these really are the
kind of references we have of them...

25
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.080
Isn't it a little contradictory?
