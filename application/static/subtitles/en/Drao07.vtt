00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.000
The brotherhood has become a symbol
of the black people's struggles

2
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.200
in Sao Paulo.

3
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.910
Struggles which
have had many exponents,

4
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.620
such as Luiz Gama, Antônio Bento

5
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.510
and many other people who took
part in the resistant movements here.

6
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.650
This place ended up being respected

7
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.400
for the resistance movements,
thanks to its historical process.

8
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.080
From 1960, the Mãe Preta statue
was installed in this place

9
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.820
paying tribute to the memory
of the black women.

Let's go inside?
