00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.280
The black man has always been
vulnerable under the eyes

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.110
of the police, because he's always
been more out on the streets...

3
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.680
always more exposed.

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.800
And what we are talking about
here is that...

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.820
racism determines the positions
where black people should be

6
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.480
throughout history.

7
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.310
Today we still notice
that blacks, in many places,

8
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.940
occupy inferior positions.
I gave the example of the boy

9
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.370
in Fundação Casa and the boy
in in Colégio Santa Cruz,

10
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.880
but let's take,
for example, healthcare.

11
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.020
Black women die more in childbirth.

12
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.370
I've mentioned before, immigrants
have built their own hospitals.

13
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.800
So when the country is responsible
for providing us health, and also

14
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.740
holding a project of systemic
extermination of the black youth

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.140
and of all black people,

16
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.820
then it will mediate,
including through healthcare,

17
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.850
who will live more
and who will live less

18
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.110
which women will die more,
which women will die less...
