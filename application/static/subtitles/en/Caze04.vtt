00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970
The municipal market you know
as the immigrants market, Mercadão,

O Mercadão, que vocês conhecem
como mercado dos imigrantes

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.600
was founded in the beginning of the
20th c. in a social cleansing process.

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.970
In the end of the 19th c. and
beginning of the 20th, Sao Paulo

4
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.420
was founded for a 2nd time.
It's in the city records,

5
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.650
the second foundation
of Sao Paulo in 1872.

6
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.170
Why? Because there's a wrong
idea, you see?

7
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.800
Pateo do Collegio was founded
in the 16th century.

8
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.820
Up to the 19th century,
the records say:

9
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.510
Sao Paulo is nothing but a
village of scholars

10
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.510
and a bunch of Indians,

11
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.220
an uninteresting city.

12
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.420
What's actually being said here?

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.970
Who are being called
uninteresting?

14
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.770
Us, Indians.

15
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.310
Sao Paulo had people,
they were spread.

16
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.880
But what is in the country's
historiography in the 16th

17
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.000
to the 18th c.? The cities of Ouro
Preto, Mariana, in Salvador, Recife,

18
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.110
places where the Gold rush took
place. Churches dating from that time

19
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.310
in these cities are luxurious, cause
it's where Brazil's wealth, sugar cane

20
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.200
and gold, was then. Sao Paulo
didn't have economic wealth then...

21
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.110
Only in the 19th c.
the coffee surge comes up.

22
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.820
Coffee plantations were
responsible for industrialization,

23
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.020
because in order to grow coffee,
you need burlap sacks, a railway line...

24
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.620
So coffee plantations ended up
industrializing Sao Paulo.

25
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.620
And then the records say

26
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.420
that in 1872, Sao Paulo
was refounded

27
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.080
and became an Italian city.

28
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.400
And this is what they tell us.
It's an Europeanized city. This

29
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.140
story is wrong. I mean, not wrong,
but it's not in my point of view.

30
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.140
In my point of view, this city
has never being uninteresting.
