00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450
Specifically in the case
of the Italians, the masters

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.000
or {\i1}capomastres{\i0}
were really valued,

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.770
they were artisans
who built many houses.

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.220
So the houses
of the Bixiga neighborhood

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.820
are strongly protected and
appraised for being historic sites,

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.280
which led to the listing
of 1000 houses as heritage sites.

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.080
This has become an obstacle
to the verticalization

8
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.680
of the neighborhood, in spite of
vertical buildings have being built

9
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.650
where houses were not listed,
and sometimes even listed houses

10
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.800
were pulled down by default.
For example, at Abolição street,

11
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.140
there's a lot owned by Silvio Santos
where once were listed houses.

12
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.540
There is a heritage decree, but
it was all pulled down anyway.
