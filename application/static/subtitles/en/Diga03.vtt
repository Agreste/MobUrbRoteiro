00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.740
We've been hearing this
unrelenting discourse

2
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.280
about the creation of cultural
centers here in Sao Paulo, which

3
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.140
is actually a way of imposing
another concept of culture

4
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.020
to wipe off stories that are not
interesting, profitable

5
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.620
or valuable
to the real estate market.

6
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.620
And this is what's
happening here at Vila ItororÃ³.

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.880
This is the dirty trick.
Everything I'm telling you now

8
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.850
could be information to be
presented at the cultural center,

9
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.850
like a good testimonial.

10
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.000
And yet they say, "look how
democratic and open to new

11
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.650
stories we are. This
is the real story,

12
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.740
our cultural center is different.

13
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.420
We present all
the perspectives of the story,

14
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.710
We want to keep
everyone's memories alive."

15
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.620
But what's really
hidden behind that discourse

16
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.200
is that this place will no longer
be a place of housing.
