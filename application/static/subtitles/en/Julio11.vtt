00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
This has once been an watershed area.
In the 18th c., there were rivers,

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.880
creeks and fountainheads all around.
And since it's located on the way

3
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.910
from Santos to here, they've built
this jesuitic house.

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.310
And the river was there, look,

5
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.170
where today is that small street.

6
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.940
The Ressaca stream ran
from here up to that square,

7
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.740
where there was
a port or something.

8
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.450
Their idea was to form
an abolitionist order

9
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.450
called The Caifazes Order.

10
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.510
They'd draft slaves, steal them
and bring them to hide here.

11
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.280
From here they went
to Santos harbor,

12
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.940
and from there, they'd try to
take a ship back to Africa.

13
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.020
But there weren't departing ships
every day, so they gathered

14
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.880
down there. They had a password
to know who was fleeing,

15
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.800
and it was this
Tupi sentence, "Ja-ba-qua-ra,"

16
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.080
which today is a noun
that gives name to the neighborhood,

17
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.420
but its literal translation
is "I came from up there."

18
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.020
And close to Santos harbor
there's a region called

19
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.340
Jabaquara, where they
did form a quilombo.

20
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.450
And today the horizon
is covered by windows...
