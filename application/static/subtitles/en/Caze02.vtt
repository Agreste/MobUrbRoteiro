00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.510
According to the historiography
of Sao Paulo,

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:10.140
Jesuits founded
Pateo do Collegio in 1554.

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.510
Speaking of it...

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.910
So they founded Pateo do Collegio
in January 25th, 1554.

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.000
This date is falsified, d'you know
why? January 25th is St. Paul's day,

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.310
so the day was chosen for the
inauguration of the place

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.570
and that's when priests
José de Anchieta and Manuel da Nóbrega

8
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.510
celebrated the first mass.
Sao Paulo is a plateau. It's plain.

9
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.140
There's a city in its southern part,
which is actually called Santo Andre

10
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.420
"of the edge of the field", located
right on the edge of the plateau.

11
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.800
Here is the Serra do Mar ridge.

12
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.280
Serra do Mar is further down, if you
go through Sao Bernardo, Sao Miguel,

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.850
Penha or the Tietê river,
you reach the coast.

14
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.020
So the colonizers came
to dwell in Pateo do Collegio.

15
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.080
which was a walled city,
very much alike medieval cities.

16
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.170
This is interesting: geography as
a strategy for occupying the land.

17
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.000
because, as it's a high plateau,
you can stay on top

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.850
and aim for any attack
by enemy Indians

19
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.680
which have actually occurred.
It was the Tamoyo Confederantion

que ocorreram. Ocorreu a confederação tamoia.

20
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.370
formed by the Tupinambás, Aimorés
and all the Tupis that didn't accept

21
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.370
Jesuit domination.
They went to fight.

22
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.140
The war lasted more than 15 years.

23
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.740
Its leaders were
Cunhambebe and Aimberê.

24
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.280
I think you should remember
this name: Aimberê.

25
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.420
Cunhambebe and Aimberê rebelled
against colonization and came

26
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.420
to Pateo do Collegio,
but they were defeated...
