00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.940
This is how Sao Paulo
would look like - and

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.170
for this I don't blame only
the governor Geraldo Alckmin -

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.110
if the Paulistan elite had had
an ecologic, environmental conscience,

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.200
we'd have one of the most beautiful
parks here in the central area,

a gente teria aqui na área central um dos parques mais bonitos,

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.020
its most beautiful part
would be the river margin.

6
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.200
Look how nice it was, all curved.

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.340
Here was what today is the Anhangabaú
river, also known as Itororó.

8
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.000
And further there
is Tietê river, look.

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.200
Strategically, the river is
important because it provides

Então estrategicamente o rio é importante
porque ele te dá água,

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.000
water and fishing, and also
attracts animals for hunting.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.220
If the river is rectified,
water flows faster.

12
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.680
If you build avenues on the river
zone, where is it going to run?

13
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.340
Of course it'll flood!

14
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.420
So if you rectify the channel, if you
use the side banks, its floodplain

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.420
- this is why it's called
floodplain, because it floods -

16
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.020
So what do you do? You kill the river.

17
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.250
Ladeira Porto Geral is not only
a street name, it's because

18
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.450
it had a river port.
This is a river town.

19
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.480
And this is why it's naturally
impossible to lack water

20
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.710
in Sao Paulo. This is
a river town, a port city.
