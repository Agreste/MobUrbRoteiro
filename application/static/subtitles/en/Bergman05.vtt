00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
Take Fundação Casa, Brazil's
juvenile detention center,

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.770
for example. Take the boy
who's in Fundação Casa

3
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.020
and the boy who's in Colégio
Santa Cruz, a prestigious school.

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.480
Their opportunities

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.820
have been completely different, right?

6
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.710
Their opportunities have a story.

7
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.570
The boy in Colégio Santa Cruz
had a path of opportunities

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.650
that will take him
to fields of authority.

9
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.650
The boy in Fundação Casa,

10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.710
had grandparents and
great-grandparents who were slaves.

11
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.170
In Fundação Casa, 90%
of the teenagers are black.

12
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.820
So probably the boy's heritage

13
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.820
is a heritage of slavery.

14
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.080
His grandparents, great-grandparents,
his ancestries were all criminalized.

15
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.940
They were brought to Brazil as slaves...

16
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.650
We know this story.

17
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.910
So the boy in Fundação Casa has
a story that took him where he is.
