00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.540
This is the tree that bled.

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.110
We call it {\i1}Iroko{\10} here,

3
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:13.340
and it carries all
the energy of the place.

4
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.200
It happened three to four years ago.
We'd ordered the tree to be pruned

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.110
because there was a bough
blocking this passageway here.

6
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.710
On the next day, that sap had
began flowing out of the tree.

7
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.340
It's red as annatto,
as if it's bleeding.

8
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.620
And this is not Brazilwood to
have such a red sap.

9
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:39.680
So I started to research and
look for answers to this.

10
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.000
Mother Silvia de Oxalá, the mentor
and idealizer of this project,

11
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.080
told me something very striking:

12
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.570
"My son, this tree is, in reality,
gushing our buried ancestors' blood"

13
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.940
Our ancestors, who're buried
inside those tunnels there,

14
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.280
under the Sítio da Ressaca House.
