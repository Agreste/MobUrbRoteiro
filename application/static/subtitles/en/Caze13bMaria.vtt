1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
I'm Yakui Tupinambá, from
the Tupinambá people of Olivença.

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.800
I couldn't join you at
the beginning at UNESP.

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.800
Yesterday, I arrived
at the end of the meeting.

4
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.740
But I believe It's been important

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.600
to be here with you today,

6
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:31.220
because I've been observing and...
I want to say this to you, Casé.

7
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.420
We, indigenous people,
have a lot to thank you.

8
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.540
The Brazilian people
have a lot to thank you,

9
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.020
and our ancestry
must be pleased and happy.

10
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.170
I'm living the decolonization,

11
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.770
which I believe to be
a necessary process

12
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.740
for those people who live here
and do not know our history.

13
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:06.080
And I don't believe a people
is capable of going anywhere

14
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.080
if it does not know
its roots, its history.

15
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.220
And the good part of it is that

16
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.940
this decolonization process
does not come from the country's

17
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:23.600
representatives, but from us,
oppressed people.

18
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.220
We come to meet you
and try to demystify our history.

19
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.620
We're neither angels nor demons.
We're human beings.

20
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.220
We have virtues and flaws.

21
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.280
But what is really important
when we speak of our planet Earth,

22
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.310
is the way we
relate ourselves to nature.

23
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.740
As a human race - because
there are no human races

24
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.710
- we're coming to an end,

25
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.650
to our end,
and in spite of that,

26
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.020
we destroy other forms of life.

27
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.140
We're responsible for that.

28
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.170
But in this planet
there are still people

29
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.310
who nurture harmonious
relationships. And I believe

30
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.740
we're responsible, as human
beings, of caring for those kinds

31
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:29.420
of relationships which preserve
and care for our Earth,

32
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.910
like we, indigenous people, do.

33
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.200
In spite of having suffered
an acculturation process,

34
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.020
we have a history. We're
bonded to our ancestors,

35
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.880
and maybe we're ready for this
because we've been brave enough

36
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.510
to come here to meet you
and try to find a way out.

37
00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.850
For no more Belo Monte dams,
for no more Mariana dam breaks,

38
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.620
for no more Madeira river dams
and so many others

39
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.620
that are yet to come
if we do nothing.

40
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.880
Today I felt bad
in Pateo do Collegio.

41
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.280
All of those guards came because
nothing can be photographed,

42
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.200
everything is locked up.
I thought, "the colonizer's here."

43
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.310
I even felt like crying

44
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.250
because that place represents pain.

45
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.680
These places we've been to,
they represent pain.

46
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.280
The pain I bear is
my ancestors' pain.

47
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.940
But do I feel hatred
for those who did this? No!

48
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.940
I am the one responsible
for changing that history.

49
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.740
I have to bring those people
that were separated back together

50
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.280
so that we can build this
new story where everyone has a role,

51
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.020
where everyone is
respected in their differences.

52
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.450
So I think we need to form
a new conscience.

53
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:10.050
A conscience of a shared
responsibility for what happens.

54
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.050
We're a small number of people,
but we've started to sow the seeds.

55
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.110
That's how we'll
reap the harvest of it.

56
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.620
And the more we sow, the more
we care for those little seeds.

57
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.740
So let's sow our seeds.

58
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.910
I invite you to sow the seeds
of this future that we all will,

59
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.280
for the preservation
of our species and of our nature.

60
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.620
And that's all.
Thank you very much.
