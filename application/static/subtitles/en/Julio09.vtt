00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.620
When the place was listed


2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.450
as a historical site,
when they were

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.050
examining the place,

4
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.280
some bones were found in here,

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.620
and also chain links
and domestic utensils.

6
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.020
The issue is that the house was
listed in the dictatorship period,

7
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.170
specifically in the period when
Brazil was a state of exception.

8
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.970
It's known that, during that
period, many people hided

9
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.080
or disappeared.

10
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.400
So there is a suspicion, I mean,
some people share this idea,

11
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.600
and it's likely that

12
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.020
if one day we can have an
archeological site here,

13
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.340
we may find more than we
once thought we'd find,

14
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.220
more than only traces of
the history of slavery.

15
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.650
Although, if we think about it, a
state of exception is also a form

16
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.050
of slavery. You get trapped
to an ideology where you can't

17
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.800
raise your voice to claim
yourself against it.
