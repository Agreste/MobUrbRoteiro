00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
The true city would be
on this side of the alley,

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.850
that would be the official side.

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.850
The city of the supposedly whites,
or those who want to be like Europeans.

4
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.400
Look that yellow building, for
example. This is why the architecture

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.710
reminds us of France, England,
Paris, London.

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.110
This city wanted to be white.

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.510
This alley is its bond to
the non-white city,

8
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.510
to the indian, black,
hick and cabocla city.

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.910
It was here where samba de roda
and samba de umbigada took place.

10
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.020
These types of samba are much
more alike the samba from Bahia.

11
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.110
It's a samba played with viola.
That's what the river zone was about.

12
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.080
This is why the alley is such an
important element, because it bonds.

13
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.020
I actually consider it more
of a bond breaker than a bonder

14
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.770
because down here you go
to the non-official city.

15
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.770
The city that is not planned.

16
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.310
The planned city
is a craftsmanship.

17
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.370
If you go to the well-planned city,
the Cidade Jardins, garden cities,

18
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.220
if you go to Brasília,
streets are straight.

19
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.620
In Londrina, streets
come and go somewhere.

20
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.570
So the alley is a public
space where people won't stay.

21
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.540
It's meant to
be only an alleyway.

22
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.880
But this alleyway has
diverse territories.

23
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.770
It can be only an alleyway if
you're on your way, but it can also

24
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.280
be a point of sale if you sell, or a
place for romance if you have a date.

25
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.250
It can even be a place of suffering.
Some people suicide by jumping off

Ele pode ser até um espaço de sofrimento.
Tem gente que se suicida no viaduto.

26
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.650
the overpass. The streets in the
outskirts of the city and the alleys

27
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.940
in the slums are winding,

28
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.370
there are angles and corners.

29
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.620
For as much as the public tries
to make the city official,

30
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.710
the city regarded
as illegal expands,

31
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.540
it boils under the surface,
alright?

32
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.110
- Is there a miss called Cris inside?

33
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.170
- Yes, it's her.

34
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.170
- What is it you're smoking?
- Is she a guide?

35
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.110
- This is lemon grass.

36
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.820
- Do you inhale it?

37
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.170
- No. You may
get dizzy if you do so.

38
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.800
- It smells good!

39
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.310
There's also a mix with this...

40
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.310
- A mix?

41
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.540
- Sir, please do not smoke in this area.

42
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.820
- We're can fart
but we can't smoke...
