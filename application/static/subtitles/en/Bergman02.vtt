00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.910
We have a number of laws

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.620
a number of mechanisms,
a number of postures, a city code

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.080
meant to criminalize
the culture and opinion

4
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.940
of those black bodies
who were coming to this country.

5
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.480
In 1876, a city code
was established in Sao Paulo

6
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.450
in which blacks were referred to
as dirty people, as tramps.

7
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.740
In 1890... 1891

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.400
there's been the establishment of
a vagrancy law in the criminal code.

9
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.820
So it’s important to notice
that all the...

10
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.140
...that the state is supported by the upper class,

11
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.250
the focus of this country
is the upper class.

12
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.170
So the "Status Juridicus"
goes hand in hand

13
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.170
with the economical status.

14
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.200
If the state saw the immigrants
as Brazil’s potential workforce

15
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.020
as Brazil’s delegated modernizers

16
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.570
the black was shut off of it.

17
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.970
So we have the criminalization
of {\i1}capoeira{\i0}, of {\i1}candomble{\i0},

18
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.540
we have the criminalization of all
black artistic and cultural expressions,

19
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.170
which goes along with this denial process...

20
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.820
this denial of a black inclusion
and also of a black citizenship, right?

21
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.370
Sao Paulo was going through this, you know?
The “Brazil’s locomotive force” and

22
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.450
“Sao Paulo never stops” mottos
are about this process...

23
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.850
It’s all related with this
bandeirante mythification.

24
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.910
In national history, the bandeirante
was the one who pioneered the land,

25
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.880
who cleared the way for development.

26
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.940
But we can’t forget that he
did it with great violence, right?

27
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.940
He was extremely violent.
