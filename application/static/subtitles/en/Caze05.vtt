00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.600
Then in the 19th c., our historiography
socially cleanses the city

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.600
How? By expelling the blacks
and Indians from the central area.

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.850
I'll give you the guy's name:
Antônio Prado, of the Prado family.

4
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.450
The Prados were a 400-year-old
family of Sao Paulo.

5
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.620
They wanted to whiten the city and
transform it into an European city.

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.200
In order to do that, one has to
plan the city's architecture

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.680
according to the French, Italian
and British models, like it

8
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.200
happened to Luz Station, for
example, and to expel

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.680
blacks, hicks, mulattos
and Indians from the central area.

10
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.540
The hick is a mixture of
Black and Indian.

11
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.970
And they did expel, right?
But they didn't win.

12
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.480
The Carmo river zone
has always been an issue

13
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.970
for the City Council to handle.

14
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.570
Washington Luiz, one of Sao Paulo's
mayor, used to say that mosquitos,

15
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.970
ill-intentioned black women and
dirty hicks crowded along that river.

16
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.020
So he ordered the construction
of Dom Pedro Park.

17
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.740
But those folks still visit Dom Pedro
park today. It's what I call territory.

18
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.800
The Carmo River zone is like a
refuge, it's Indian, black land.

19
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.740
The City Council can try to expel

20
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.420
peddlers from Vinte e Cinco de
Março street, but they'll come back.

21
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.420
They were there before the Koreans,
the Chinese, the Arabic, alright?

22
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.680
It's territory.

23
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.600
Another place I want you
to realize as being a territory

24
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.540
is Liberdade Avenue. Do you
know why? It's very interesting.

25
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.200
In order to have a Court House,
a city needed a pillory or a gallows.

26
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200
Sao Paulo had a gallows,

27
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.310
where Indians, blacks and poor
people were hanged.

28
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.250
They died asphyxiated...

29
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.650
in the Liberdade Square.

30
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.200
On the 13th of May, when
the abolition of slavery was decreed,

31
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.600
the square name changed from
"Gallows Square" to "Liberty Square."

32
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.370
The Liberdade St. was indeed
a street of liberty, because

33
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.020
it was a scape route
for slaves.

34
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.600
Through Liberdade St., they went
to the region called Jabaquara.

35
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.280
Jabaquara is the coastal quilombo,
a former escaped slaves settlement.

36
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.970
In the Liberty Park there's the
small "church of the hanged men."

37
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.770
And do you know why we call it
"church of the hanged men?"

38
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.170
Because the condemned men
went there to pray.

39
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.480
And if you go right beside
the "church of the hanged men"

40
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.400
there is a candomble
products retailer.

41
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.220
In front of it, there are
people selling roots

42
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.740
and healing products. And behind
it there's a social security office.

43
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.850
So, the "church of the hanged man"
is also a black, indigenous territory,

44
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.850
right in the middle of
a Japanese neighbourhood.
