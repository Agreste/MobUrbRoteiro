00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.540
Let me show you a picture.

2
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.280
I want to show you how
history repeats itself.

3
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.510
This is the picture.

4
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.940
Look, 1870.

5
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.020
This is the landlord,

6
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.910
and these are his ex-slaves,

7
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.650
who didn't have a place to go
so they stayed with the landlord.

8
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.740
One of the most significative
marks of a slave was that they

9
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.510
weren't allowed to wear shoes.

10
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.280
This was the kind
of humiliation they'd suffer.

11
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.650
Besides, the white man was allowed
to have sex with their wives

12
00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:00.370
to whiten their race.

13
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.140
Now, there were
all these social obstacles

14
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.020
that the "freed",
so to speak, slaves had to face.

15
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.420
And that's where today's
prejudice, discrimination and

16
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.710
other kinds of slavery
have been founded.

17
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.710
People are enslaved by what
they've lived in the past

18
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.710
or by what they've been through.
Never by their true essence.

19
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.280
We've inherited
all this prejudice,

20
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.820
all the racism, exclusion,
everything we see nowadays.

21
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.420
Behind each of these things
there's a story of struggle,

22
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.800
of bloodshed. I don't want
to put up with this.

24
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.420
I don't want my children and
grandchildren to put up with

25
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.600
this story which may have
been told us in a wrong way.
