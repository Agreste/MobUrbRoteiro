00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.540
We must realize
it's an ongoing process,

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.220
a brutal process of gentrification

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.420
within the concept of city-company
of neoliberal capitalism,

4
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.680
an expansive, pervasive process
that is always being reshaped.

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.620
It's not a campaign against Haddad,

6
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.620
it's a matter of who are
the actors behind the scenes

7
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.310
who are interested in producing
and transforming the city.

8
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.170
What happens is that, with the
Arquitetura da Gentrificação

9
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.280
project, I've started to research
the last two city administrations

10
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.540
before Haddad, which were
Serra's and Kassab's.

11
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.450
Occasionally I've realized that

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.110
there's an ongoing project of
these urban public policies

13
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.020
since the beginning of that period.
So I thought I had to go into them.

14
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.280
It was clear to me that there's no
political ideology, only business.

15
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.880
Deep down, it's the same people.

16
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.970
The same actors interested in
the same parts of the city

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.340
who will charge
for financed campaign debts

18
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.200
from the representatives
whenever they're elected.

19
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.450
There's nothing else to say.
I mean,

20
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.770
Haddad graffitied Donald Duck and
people made T-shirts out of it:

21
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.620
"I, graffitied Donald Duck, São
Paulo," have you seen this?

22
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.940
I mean, it got to that point...

23
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.220
- but doing a graffiti
of Donald Duck was awesome!

24
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.770
- So "radical", right?
- It's so evident!

25
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.420
- Yeah, like, a Freudian slip.

26
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.420
- Scrooge McDuck
would've been worse.
