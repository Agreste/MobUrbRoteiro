00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
I'll say some more things here...

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.280
You've already learned that this is
a clerical place of the Catholic Church.

3
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.250
I mean, we believe it's
all about a domination system,

4
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.940
and it's obvious, isn't it?

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.310
All this area around here has
a presence of the Catholic Church.

6
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.880
What bothers me is not even its
presence. It's the rest of it.

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.510
The structures of power
are all around here.

8
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.650
As your previous guide have said,
the church itself was destroyed

9
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.340
in the end of the 19th c. and
beginning of the 20th. All of this

10
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.050
had vanished and turned into a
public space by the local government.

11
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.420
It became the government palace,

12
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.820
the actual Bandeirantes Palace.

13
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.970
And the name "Bandeirantes"
is very representative of all these

14
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.220
structures of power, right?

15
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.710
Like, these pilasters reminds
us of the Roman Empire.

16
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.000
There's a will to be Rome,

17
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.450
to be the big Roman Empire.

18
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.480
These pilasters refer to classical
architecture, but there are also

19
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.680
gothic elements in it.
It's an architectonic carnival.

20
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.680
Thinking about an archeology
of this city's architecture,

21
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.020
when you walk around this city and
see this type of architecture,

22
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.800
you'll know it dates back to the
end of the 19th c. up to the 30's,

23
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.970
in-between this period of strong
whitening policies, of killing indians,

24
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.680
blacks, hicks and caboclos.
And that was not all of it!

25
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.020
The criminal code wouldn't allow
you to walk barefoot around the city,

26
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.080
it was forbidden
to sell roots on the streets...

27
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.020
And as I've said,
Walter Benjamin teaches us

28
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.400
that in order to talk about those
who haven't left any photographs,

29
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.480
and any written data, because
they haven't known how to write well,

30
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.170
you need a counter move
to find anything worthy.

31
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.170
This is what we're doing here. In
order to unveil the popular history

32
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.020
in the 19th, 16th, 17th c.,
we are making a counter move.

33
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.910
We'll find the Indian and the black
in the Criminal Code, right?

34
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.220
And we can rely on our elderly
ancestrals' memoirs.

35
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.450
Very well. So we decoded a
social cleansing process in here,

36
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.450
and this place is part of it.
