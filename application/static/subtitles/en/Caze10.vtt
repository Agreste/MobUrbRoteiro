00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.570
I just want to show you this here...

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.480
This is what we call territory.

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.480
Maybe it doesn't have an
architectonic value

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.110
of beauty, right?

5
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.110
But it holds a symbolic value.

6
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.310
And by symbolic value, I mean...

7
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.000
It's an immaterial bequest.

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.140
It's the meaning people
give to physical space.

9
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.480
So you can see that the alley,
further down past the river zone,

Então você vê que o beco, lá além
já na várzea já dá em outro beco.

10
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.200
leads to another valley. Right after
you can see the Tamanduateí floodplain

11
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.020
structure, also called
Carmo floodplain, right?

12
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.000
And I'll say it again: it's
a very nice place for you to explore.

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.170
The northeastern culture is very
present there. Binho and I have just

14
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.800
stopped to listen to a guy from
Bahia singing arroxa and it was nice.

15
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.110
So this popular culture
is always being resignified.

16
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.510
For me, when a place is preserved
as National Heritage, it's not only

17
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.620
for it's aesthetic value.
It's because of the territory itself.

18
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.850
For me, the Carmo floodplain, where
our relatives are, is of best value.

19
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.400
The Tamanduateí river
is buried there.

20
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.620
There are street vendors there.
Popular people are there.

21
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.020
For me, that place is much more
valuable than this entire building,

22
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.970
because it's formed by all of that
which I call immaterial bequest.

23
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.050
But why is it we pay more
attention to this building?

24
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.050
Because we can see all the luxury
of Sao Paulo's elite. And that's why

25
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.140
I usually say, when people blame
governor Geraldo Alckmin for our

26
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.400
current lack of water and for the
harshness of the city, he's not

27
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.400
the only one to be blamed. These
issues have owners: the elite.
