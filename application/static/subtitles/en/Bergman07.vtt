00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
In Brazil, there's a whole set of
elements that have been formulated

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:12.200
and developed by the elite to place
the black wherever they wanted.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.680
We have a state governor
who lives in a palace, right?

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.680
The Bandeirantes Palace, our
governor official residence.

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.200
If we take the story
behind it we'll understand

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.020
why the governor
is in the Bandeirantes Palace

7
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.220
and the blacks are in Fundação Casa,
Brazil's juvenile detention center,

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.940
which is pretty antagonistic if
we think of a path of humanization,

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.310
isn't it? Fundação Casa,
the prisons, the female prisons...

10
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.250
they're places of confinement

11
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.820
where people are thrown in there.

12
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.910
And the governor is in a palace...

13
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.910
It's still like an imperial-like 
atmosphere, isn't it?
