00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.910
- What's up, Claudio?
New earrings?

3
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.910
- It's my mic.
- Oh! The mic.

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.620
So, the jesuitic houses
were marked by a cross sign

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.800
followed by its year of foundation.

6
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.820
And they were also
characterized by the small altar

7
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.770
located on the houses's highest wall.

8
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.940
Another thing that this
house presents here are

9
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.220
some symbols scratched
on the doors, windows,

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.250
and all around the building.

11
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.510
And it has to do with
this word-of-mouth story.

12
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.110
We've started to go over these
symbols and look for their meanings,

13
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.110
like we did with this one,
which is an anchor, see?

14
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.370
What does an anchor
has to do with a rural house?

15
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.080
The thing is, when people came
to hide in here, they'd know

16
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.480
this was the right place
because of this symbol.

17
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.400
they'd say, "this
will take me where the anchor is."

18
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.220
That is, to Santos harbor.

19
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.800
So they'd communicate
through these symbols.

20
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.770
Besides, we know the anchor
is also a Christian symbol.

21
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.420
The arc represents the world
being sustained by the cross here,

22
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.650
which also forms a war sword.

23
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.280
On this window frame,
we have the second letter

24
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.200
of the Masonic alphabet,
which is letter "b"

25
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.600
as you can see here.

26
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.740
The letter "b"
in Hebrew is called "Boaz."

27
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.820
Boaz is the symbol of
companionship and welcoming.

28
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.800
So we've started to realize
that there are these traces

29
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.570
of that word-of-mouth story.

30
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.310
There are other symbols, look.

31
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.280
This is the Masonic flower,
the Acacia flower.

32
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.250
And up here too.

33
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.450
In here, it's the circle
that represents the universe...
