00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.940
Now, in here we see that many
references to black saints:

2
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.680
St. Benedict the Moor,
St. Elesbaan of Axum,

3
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.800
Our Lady of Sorrows, St. Roch...

4
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.200
You can notice how in this church,
the Rosary of Black People,

5
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.800
there are many Catholic saints,
which are very related

6
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.140
to syncretic religions
of African descent.

7
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.050
For example, St. Roch
is syncretized with Obaluaê deity,

8
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.400
St. Barbara with Iansã deity.

9
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.340
St. anne, with Nanã.

10
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.510
And it's a worship of black saints

11
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.570
which have become symbols
of the resistance movements

12
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.570
to the population of black slaves.

13
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.110
Here we have St. Benedict,
worshiped

14
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.080
not only by the black brotherhoods

15
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.570
but also in the {\i1}Congados{\i0},
feast-day dramatized celebrations.

16
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.170
Here we also have St. George,
a very well known saint both to

17
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.800
popular catholicism and to religions
of African descent, such as Umbanda.
