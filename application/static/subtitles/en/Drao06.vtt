00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
Much is said of Sao Paulo's
multiculturalism

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.680
and of its diverse population,

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.680
but very little is spoken
of the black population.

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.480
Why? The historical process in
in Sao Paulo has been different

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.050
from Rio de Janeiro's and
Salvador's, that were capital cities.

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.940
In Sao Paulo, the black population
still arrived in great numbers

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.570
when slavery had already started to
be called into question. With the

8
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.250
beginning of the coffee surge and the
ending of the international slave trade,

9
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.020
from where did the biggest share
of the black population come from?

10
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.510
It came from the so called
interprovincial slave trade,

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.110
by which black people who were dismissed
from Rio's and northeast plantations

12
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.110
and sent here to Sao Paulo.

13
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.800
Every city with a big share
of black population

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.020
has gone through massive
processes of gentrification,

15
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.820
racial and social segregation.

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.220
It couldn't have been different
with Sao Paulo.

17
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.620
However, we also know

18
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.620
that capitalism has developed in
the most literal meaning of the word

19
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.340
here in Sao Paulo.

20
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.800
Capitalism established new
social relations of production.

21
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.310
A new workforce is necessary to comply
with that. That's the reason of

22
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.800
the immigration project, which is
meant to whiten the population.

23
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.480
The impact of the gentrification process
on the indigenous and black populations

24
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.480
is historical and it's still ongoing.

25
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.050
The very same process, 
for over 500 years.
