00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
The dwelling people of the
town house were its wealth.

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.080
It was a town house with a yard,
no turnstiles whatsoever,

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.140
it had many exits...
An exit to 23 de Maio avenue,

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.970
another one here...

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.400
there was right to come and go,
children playing,

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.450
people sitting on their
chairs talking in the yard.

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.710
They organized celebrations,
June festivals.

8
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.220
It was an extremely active
cultural center.

9
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.110
And independent, administrated
by the association of dwellers.

10
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.020
And all of that is now dead
thanks to the protection

11
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.650
and refurbishment of the building.
"Let's kick people out"

12
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.540
The discourse is:
"People are ruining the place.

13
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.540
"People are trashing the place."

14
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.420
We can't even see it.

15
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.220
This is the back,
there's a stairway here.

16
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.250
I remember the dwellers
have pulled together.

17
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.370
The association of dwellers put
together community task forces

18
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.800
to maintain the place. So they'd
join together to pluck the weeds,

19
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.680
refurbish the stairs, make the slab
of the association headquarters.

20
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.080
So this consciousness
of community worked really well,

21
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.170
they maintained the place
with their own resources.

22
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.710
That was settled
and then dismantled.

23
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.850
Actually, no public authority,
neither local nor state,

24
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.280
at any moment, have presented
a project to these people.

25
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.000
They never asked, "Let's refurbish
this listed-as-heritage place?

26
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.200
Let's keep it as a housing
place and refurbish it?

27
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.250
Let's have a dialogue and find
a way out for every dweller

28
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.020
wishing to stay here and

29
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.050
have a history here?"

30
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.570
Lady Lourdes, in the town house
for 60 years.

31
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.850
AntÃ´nia, in the town house
for 30 and something years.

32
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.820
The last one, she
resisted until the very end.

33
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.650
Many people had
a history in this place

34
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.850
and used this place
in an autonomous, free way.

35
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:46.450
And on account of a supposedly
landmarking as material heritage,

36
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.370
the immaterial heritage
has been destroyed.

37
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.910
So easily, as if by magic.

38
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.200
There were people, culture,
a whole way of living,

39
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.970
all ended

40
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.000
on account of landmarking material
heritage in the most conservative way,

41
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.570
even because half of the town house
has been demolished.

42
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.000
That is, the more recent
add-ons have no value at all.

43
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.710
Forms of life
that have adjusted themselves

44
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.280
to live in that place for
the last years, "Let's erase them".
