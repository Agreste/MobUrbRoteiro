00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
What happened to this
town house is no new story.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.140
The property was passed on
from one owner to the other

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.140
throughout the years.

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.940
The Portuguese guy who brought
the place forth passed away,

5
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.880
and so it was passed on to someone
else who got very ill and passed,

6
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.850
and he willed it to be donated
to the charity hospital Santa Casa

7
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:35.910
of a city in the countryside.
Then, in 1996, the town house's been

8
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.420
listed as a heritage site and
Santa Casa claimed, "alright,

9
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.050
this is not ours anymore,
its the city's,"

10
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.570
And they stopped collecting rent.

11
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.420
In that time, ten years had passed,
time enough to reclaim it through

12
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.740
usucaption and because of the
dwelling families' right of housing.

13
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.370
This project of the cultural center
was designed in the 70's.

14
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.050
It's amazing how it's been so
many years of resistance here

15
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.740
and the dwellers of the town house,
the association of dwellers making

16
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.570
movements, trying to find solutions
to the issue, were not allowed

17
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.020
to see the project. So that's
how it happened, they said,

18
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.850
"- We're going to kick you out
and build a cultural center.

19
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.620
- Can we see the project?
- No, we're using it for

20
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.110
the refurbishment process..."

21
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.710
Nobody really knew what
was going to happen there.

22
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.650
And the project was taken forward.

23
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.110
In 2006, there was a legal action.______

Em 2006 duas ações entraram em disputa.

24
00:01:48.620 --> 00:02:00.280
The state of Sao Paulo sued ___________


O estado de São Paulo entrou
com um processo de desapropriação da vila

25
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.680
to transform it into a public space

pra tornar a vila um espaço público

26
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.370
and the dwellers of the association
of dwellers ___________

e os moradores da associação de moradores
entraram com um processo de usucapião

27
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.170
I don't even have to mention
that the lawsuit for usucaption

Eu não preciso dizer que
o processo de usucapião nunca andou. Está parado.

28
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.740
has never been taken forward, do I?
So the court discussed it and said

E aí houve uma discussão,
há uma discussão da jurisprudência

29
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.800
there can't be a process of
usucaption of public properties.

dizendo que não existe
usucapião para bens públicos.

30
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.370
So it's a double move

Aí você tem essa dobra, né?

31
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.680
Reclaiming the place and blocking
the right of usucaption. ________

Você desapropria e trava o direito do usucapião.

32
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.020
That's how it goes.

Então a coisa está nesse processo.

33
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.880
Time is passing, the cultural center
is still running, that is,

O tempo está passando.
O centro cultural continua fluindo

34
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.310
a new use
of the place's been determined.

ou seja, afirmando uma nova prática do lugar.

35
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.340
So I stopped participating
in the discussions

Eu me afastei da conversa
porque eu não acredito nela.

36
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.880
because I don't believe in it.
I hope I'm wrong.

Tomara esteja errado.
