00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.710
I think we have to open a dialogue
with the people in the forefront

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.820
of the battle. We have to listen
to the vulnerable populations,

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.620
to the ones who
get screwed up first.

4
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.940
We have to know how or at least
try to engage in dialogue

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.710
with them, the first ones

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.970
to suffer with the processes
of the public sector,

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.140
and also with
our actions, don't they?

8
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.250
Actions we take,

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.970
many times with
the best of intentions,

10
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.420
thinking it would be inclusive,
democratic, sensitive of the needs

11
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.910
of vulnerable populations,
but actually,

12
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.050
we'd be shooting them in the foot.
So that's why I think dialogue

13
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.340
is the primary thing, and then
thinking about an essentially

14
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.480
anticapitalist agenda,
which is very hard, isn't it?

15
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.510
So, understanding what kind
of things would be in the agenda,

16
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.740
what anticapitalist things we
could do that wouldn't be treated

17
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.740
as capital by the City Council,
or by ItaÃº Bank, or Porto Seguro

18
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.370
insurance company, or by...

19
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.620
I don't know, anyone.

20
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.680
I think that's a way.

21
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.680
It's hard. There's nothing ready.
There's no magical formula.

22
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.450
But if we withdraw from dialogue,

23
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.200
we won't get anywhere.

24
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.200
I really hope those people
to organize themselves,

25
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.400
unite themselves
and go for it, you know?

26
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.710
I'd really like to see such thing
and also a mutual understanding

27
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.000
from all of us, specially from
those who are privileged with

28
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.000
all those historical
privileges we've heard of,

29
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.080
that they'd question their
own privileges, and in doing so,

30
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.540
that they can break down
the very idea of privilege.
