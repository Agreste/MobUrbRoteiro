00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.740
He can go in, see?
The kitten can go in.

2
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.450
Look.

3
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.820
"For sale."

4
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.340
It's all for sale.

5
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.340
It's all for sale.

6
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.200
"For sale".
The whole street is for sale.

7
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.250
All of a sudden.

8
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.800
It's impressive. In 2013, the
last eviction happened,

9
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.710
a real state market boom
happend on the surroundings.

10
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.340
Look at this: the building has been
put up at an incredible speed

11
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.200
And it's not the only one.
There are many of them.

12
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.940
So, like, this used to be a
car wash... so someone bought

13
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.400
a cheap lot just waiting
for things to flourish.

14
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.080
When the population that
lived here is evicted,

15
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.510
the lot becomes a prime area, "oh!
there will be a cultural center!"

16
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.340
So they put up buildings.

17
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.570
You can see many signs
of "for sale" there,

18
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.220
which means prices have
duplicated, triplicated

19
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.510
on account of having
a cultural center nearby.
