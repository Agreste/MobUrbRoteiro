00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.050
We're the outcome of a system,

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.710
an economical and social
system of exclusion.

3
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.650
And this is not ideologic, it's
not about being against capitalism.

4
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.540
It's nothing to do with that.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.650
It's just that some values
are not preserved by this system.

6
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.450
There's an oriental identity in the
Liberdade neighborhood today

7
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.250
But before that, there's
been another identity

8
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.020
that wasn't even
allowed to be there.

9
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.820
But in here, we've
already had that identity.

10
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.220
Even before the discussion
about Afro-descendants,

11
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.510
we had an indigenous identity.

12
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.880
So things got stuck in here.

13
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.110
Now, that story echoes
in the older families' speech,

14
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.620
the older families who lived
here can tell us that story.

15
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.570
But are there any records of it?
No, there aren't.
