00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020
Guys, you can come in.

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.020
- Excuse us.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.050
Come in, make yourselves at home.

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.370
I'll leave the door open
to let some air in.

5
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.250
This building had been
empty for seventeen years.

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.220
It had been a hotel, the
Columbia Palace hotel,

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.140
and it's been unoccupied for
all this time until the movement

8
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.250
took it over. By that time,
there was a lot of debris.

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.850
Almost everything was ruined.

10
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.080
There were dead animals
like pigeons and rats inside.

11
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.770
It was dangerous for the people
that used to pass by and work

12
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.420
around here, they could have
caught some disease or something.

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.050
When the movement took it over,
it's become almost habitable.

14
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.570
There was no power grid,

15
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.050
no water in the
clogged iron pipes.

16
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.540
And then all that space
was resignified.

17
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.800
And when we saw that happen,

18
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.600
it was a kind of relief

19
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.680
to know that it's possible
to collectively build something

20
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.220
like that.
It was an amazing experience.
