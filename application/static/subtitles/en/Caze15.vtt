00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.370
Come on cows!

3
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.450
Let me call them...

4
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.510
Is there anyone here from
the Polytechnic School?

5
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.800
The Polytechnic School
of the University of Sao Paulo

6
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.140
is an engineering school built
in the end of the 19th c.

7
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.480
I'll tell you some
of the Sao Paulo's mayors

8
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.650
who have studied there:
Anhaia Melo, Prestes Maia,

9
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.650
one that you "like"
a lot, Paulo Maluf,

10
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.510
MÃ¡rio Covas, and
Kassab also studied there.

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.850
Many of Sao Paulo's mayors
have graduated from

12
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.400
the Polythecnic School in order to
run the city under their technical

13
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.370
prospects, and also
to expel and whiten people,

14
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.620
to take us, poor people -
I mean, not us, just you

15
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.170
because I'm not poor - out
of the upper side areas.

16
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.680
In 1954, in
Sao Paulo's fourth centenary,

17
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.770
a lot of Sao Paulo's
past was resignified.

19
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.770
It also happened in the time
of the Modern Art Week in 1922,

20
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.110
the Indians were resignified

21
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.820
because it was believed that
the Indians would disappear.

22
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.620
Villa-Lobos wore a headdress
and feathers during the Art Week.

23
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.710
So in 1954, Sao Paulo's past
was also resignified in regard

24
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.710
to Indians and bandeirantes.

25
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.620
Of course the bandeirantes were
not that clean and tidy in their

26
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.850
livery uniforms.
They were trailblazers, right?

27
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.680
Sometimes,

28
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.710
many of those regarded as
bandeirantes, as pioneers, were

29
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.770
actually Indians or blacks...
These humbugs have always existed.
