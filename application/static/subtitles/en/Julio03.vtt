00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.620
This was the first
cultural center of Sao Paulo.

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.420
The first project for the
São Paulo Cultural Center

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.420
at Vergueiro St. stemmed from here.

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.220
In the '70s this place was
appropriated by the metro company.

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.480
And these neighborhoods came along.

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.600
When the Itaú Bank built
its headquarters here at Conceição

7
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.220
this region started to be speculated
in the real estate market. Why?

8
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.340
because a new population of

9
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.570
executives, bank managers and
people of higher classes came along

10
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.050
because the bank
was then seated here.

11
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.110
And from thereon this region
has started to be speculated

12
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.680
and the population that was here
before migrated to other places.

13
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.910
So people who had these stories

14
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.540
left with them to other communities

15
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.540
even further in the outskirts.

16
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.000
But this situation...

17
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.400
remains unsolved...
