00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.650
The movement is having a dialogue
with the public authorities,

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.740
the department of housing
and the City Council.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.420
We want them to buy that
building from the owner

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.680
and to pay by installments
along the years through

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.140
the Minha Casa Minha Vida
housing program, which would

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.140
be a way for
the families here to pay.

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.740
A penthouse still under
construction here will cost

9
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.280
40 million reals.

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.770
With that money one could buy
around 4 buildings like this,

11
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.970
and 91 families could live
in each one of them.

12
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.220
So, like... you know?

13
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.310
The numbers are scary.

14
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.910
And this real-estate corruption
will take place, and do you think

15
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.940
any of these families could
afford to pay something like...


16
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.800
not even all of them
together would afford it.

17
00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.940
Imagine that building
costing 40 million reals,

18
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.940
be it one million, just
to make it somehow better

19
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.420
for the real-state
appreciation rates.

20
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.170
The low-income people
working downtown,

21
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.910
trying to build
their lives in Sao Paulo,

22
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.050
they're not gonna make it.

23
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.170
The conflict will last forever.

24
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.800
People live in the outskirts
and keep going back and forth,

25
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.340
they get alienated
in their routine.

26
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.340
I think times have changed.

27
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.050
I think the government must
provide quality of life for

28
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.650
the population.
They only marketize it.

29
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.310
If they were a little more
coherent in their proposals,

30
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.400
people's lives could get better.

31
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.020
And so this social inequality
controlled by few empowered

32
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.600
people would diminish a little

33
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.820
would become
a little bit more balanced,

34
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.510
less unequal.
