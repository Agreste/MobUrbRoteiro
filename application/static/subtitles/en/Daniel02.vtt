00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.370
Let's go inside then.

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.310
Before I joined the movement,
everyone I used to talk to

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.710
considered squatters
to be transgressors.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.650
They'd misjudge it completely.

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.740
You see, they'd been
influenced by the media.

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.620
Living in a squat, as I came
to realize, and which is natural,

7
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.650
is something that only people
really in need do, who're

8
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.310
really struggling
for a place to live.

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.740
The squats belong to the media

10
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.400
and to the dominating class.

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.200
So they use information
the way they want it to be.

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.310
to sustain the domination in
the hands of some elite, you see?

13
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.050
They'll never
show the true situation

14
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.140
of people who are living in
a squat and struggling for a home.

15
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.450
They're humble, working people.

16
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.620
And they'll show an image completely
distorted from the reality image.

17
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.000
The media is today what I believe

18
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.110
to be the opposite of what
it was supposed to be.

19
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.000
Instead of being sensationalist

20
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.220
and providing false information,

21
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.370
it should show us real facts.

22
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.620
It's definitely not what happens.

23
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.710
Many construction companies, owners
of many buildings here in Sao Paulo,

24
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.340
have capital to invest.

25
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.650
I can't recall their names now.

26
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.770
And so that the population stays
by their side, they have influence

27
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.940
on the media so that it won't

28
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.910
show news that go against them.

29
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.110
A more recent example,

30
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.020
I don't know if it's going to
be a problem to say it: Itaú.

31
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.770
Itaú Bank is now privatizing
many places in the city,

32
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.340
like squares, with the
government permission.

33
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.570
There's this matter regarding
the real state speculation,

34
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.540
which we from the movement
call real state corruption,

35
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.770
that is, they're investing in
the city centre, making it

36
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.820
a prime area, and so people
with less conditions...

37
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.080
street dwellers, other dwellers

38
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.220
end up having to leave the place,
which in theory is everyone's.

39
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.820
Then what happens? Itaú sells an
image by refurbishing the centre,

40
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.680
placing public equipments

41
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.480
but in reality it's improving
the space so that it serves

42
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.940
people who will be capable of
providing them with financial return.
