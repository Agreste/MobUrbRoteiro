00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.370
Oh, I forgot
to talk about the fence!

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.850
I forgot to say something
important here, the fence...

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.820
This is a new thing in Sao Paulo
nowadays, this churches' fence.

4
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.220
When I, Mauricio and Marli
worked at Guarulhos' City Hall,

5
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.600
where there's also a RosÃ¡rio
Church with many street vendors,

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.400
the church made a complain
to the City Council because

7
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.710
the street vendors were peeing
on its walls. Mauricio and I

8
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.510
thought to ourselves, "there's
no washroom for them to go."

9
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.510
So the City Council decreed
the church should be fenced.

10
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.480
Now, the street vendors don't
pee on the walls anymore.

11
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.540
They pee on the fence.

12
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.850
And so, fencing churches is only
another one of those things

13
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.450
that won't help the guy with
an ordinary folk culture.

14
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.450
Well, let's go this way now.
