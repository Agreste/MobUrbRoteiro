00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In 1903, the Paissandú Square
was a mangrove forest.

2
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.400
Nobody wanted to go there.
There was nothing there.

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.650
From 1903 to 1905, the brotherhood
who came from the former Rosário Square

4
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.710
went to the Paissandú Square,
absolutely shattered,

5
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.820
without any financial conditions
to put up its headquarters

6
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.170
which took almost
5 years to be rebuilt.

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.110
Given that, many brothers
spread around the downtown area.

8
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.200
That same kind
of segregation practice

9
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.420
happened in the Bixiga neighbourhood
with the immigrants arrival,

10
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.280
fostered by an official
whitening policy.

11
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.910
Many places in Bixiga that once
had been territories of blacks

12
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.400
were lost thanks to that
new arriving population.

13
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.250
Another territory
is Barra Funda neighborhood.

14
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.450
Where today is
the Latin America Memorial,

15
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.600
was once the former Banana Square,
an important place for trade.

16
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.280
The streets were very important
to the black population.

17
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.650
An important place of resistance.

18
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.400
So this processes of gentrification,
and of racial and urban segregation

19
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.620
lead to the end of Banana Square
and the construction of the Latin

20
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.050
America Memorial. Again, where did
the segregated black population go?

21
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.820
They spread throughout Barra Funda,

22
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.710
Casa Verde and Santana, and
kept on with the resistance movements.
