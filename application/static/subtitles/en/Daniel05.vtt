00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.710
This is the Aquarius building.

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.570
It should actually
be called Aquarius hotel.

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.170
I've kept up with all the
eviction action of this place.

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.850
It was really violent.

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.450
And the news...

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.200
said it was encroachment, that
it wasn't their property...

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.770
But then, like...

8
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.220
About one year later,
it's still the same way.

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.650
The media knows, the public
departments know, and still

10
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.140
there's no prospective
use for this space.

11
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.940
No trucks are coming for the
refurbishment of the building.

12
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.250
You see, it remains untouched, and
the owner gives no explanation

13
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.280
for it. There are more than twenty
thousand abandoned buildings.

14
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.220
around the city. I mean,
not all of them are proper places

15
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.220
to become dwellings,
but many of them are, right?

16
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.970
Some analysis claim that if
all of these buildings were

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.280
remodeled to become
low-cost housing,

18
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.220
90% of all of the city's
housing problems could diminish.

19
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.800
So the question is: why not even
a small part of this is happening?

20
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.250
Our constitution is
ambiguous in some cases.

21
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.220
It says all citizens
have a right to own property.

22
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.910
but it also says that the owner
must grant a social function

23
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.740
of property. And when the owner
doesn't care about what happens

24
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.170
to a building that's been
stuck for years, he doesn't

25
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.370
comply with
the social function clause,

26
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.420
but he's not punished, you know?

27
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.080
There's no
supervisory body on this.

28
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.450
There's the issue about
the progressive tax rate,

29
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.370
but nobody really cares about it.

30
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.170
And it's so funny if you think...

31
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.540
A judge receives a request by
the owner for an eviction action

32
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.650
and he knows there's a
need to grant a social function

33
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.570
of property, or else
the owner loses his ownership.

34
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.680
The request is for the eviction
of 90 to 300 families.

36
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.820
Where do these families go?

37
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.740
And what about the right of
property the state was supposed to

38
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.280
provide for these people?
The legal system ends up

39
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.110
privileging one person over many
others who are in a lower condition.

40
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.000
And this is the case
with that building.

41
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.050
It's hard to wake up each morning,
open the window and see an empty

42
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.480
building that could be
the dwelling of some 200 families.

43
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.800
There are security guards all
around, two to three of them,

44
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.220
guarding concrete, while lots
of people live on the streets

45
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.110
or struggle to pay the rent
in the suburbs.
