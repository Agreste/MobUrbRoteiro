00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.910
The obelisk is a symbol of the
Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932.

2
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.000
There are even battlers' remains
inside it and all...

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.970
The Constitutionalist
Revolution of 1932 was...

4
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.770
It was a war, a dispute between

5
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.140
the Minas Gerais
and Sao Paulo states,

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.820
the two economic powers of that time.

7
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.110
What is interesting about
the Constitutionalist Revolution...

8
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.910
is that just like in the first
independence centenary in 1922

9
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.710
the bandeirante is also
presented as the big hero,

10
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.110
as the pioneer... So the bandeirante
image was made up.

11
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.620
In 1932, the image of the bandeirante
as the battler was also made up.

12
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.200
He was the big defensor
of the 1932 Revolution.

13
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.940
It is important for us
to recognize that our city

14
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.370
is formed by symbols closely
related to this bandeirante myth,

15
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.420
which is the founding myth of this city.

16
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.970
So here we have these monuments:
the obelisk,

17
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.970
the Monument to the Bandeiras...

18
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.140
And there are many streets
here in Sao Paulo,

19
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.000
which are named after bandeirantes:

20
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.420
The Bandeirantes, Anhanguera
and Raposo Tavares highways, for example.

21
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.600
Oh! An important historical fact:

22
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.170
The paulistan bandeirantes were the
most violent ones in Brazil's history.

23
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.080
Sao Paulo exported bandeirantes
and their methods to other states.

24
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.800
Domingos Jorge Velho, for example,

25
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.740
was exported to Pernambuco.

26
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.280
He lead the massacre of the
Quilombo dos Palmares.

27
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.680
So the worst kind of bandeirantes

28
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.480
were exported from this state
to the rest of the country.

29
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.970
And this is a mark of our story.

30
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.220
And so, I think it's important
for us to recognize the city's

31
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.800
historical symbols, and to understand
the violence within them.
