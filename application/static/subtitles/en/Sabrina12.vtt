00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970
Capitalism makes money
out of any damn thing.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.740
I'll give you a crude example:
your need to take a shit.

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.620
I've read Mike Davis's
Planet of Slums and it

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.800
says that in India, there's a
huge problem concerning public

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.970
toilet facilities. There's one
latrine for like 10,000 people.

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.970
I don't know, I mean,
10,000 is a hyperbole.

7
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.420
500 people.

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.850
What do they do? Some guys build
facilities and charge for it.

9
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.710
They charge people for using it.

10
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.420
I mean, fuck! Making profit
out of one's most basic needs

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.280
is too much of a bad joke, isn't it?

12
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.910
And we don't have to go that far.

13
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.450
If we have to go to the restroom
in a joint, we're allowed in.

14
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.250
In theory,
for the sake of modesty,

15
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.140
we'll buy at least a bottle of
water so it's not awkward.

16
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.280
A street dweller, on the
other hand, won't be allowed in,

17
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.880
not even paying,
he won't step inside.

18
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.020
That's it. Are there any public
facilities here? No, there aren't.

19
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.020
People have to
poop and pee on the streets.
