00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080
There's been another project, an
alternative to Tosi's cultural center,

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:15.420
and according to this other project,
it would be possible to refurbish

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.970
the place and use it for housing.
The project was the building of

4
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.940
a housing area where there's
a warehouse, we'll go there

5
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.220
and see it, and it was so that
the dwellers moving out of here

6
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.850
went to live there.

7
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.170
The refurbishment would take place

8
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.850
with both the creation of a cultural
center and the dwellers living there,

9
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.370
which would have been a way of
both having a housing place and

10
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.220
of preserving the immaterial culture.
This project has been conducted

11
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.600
by Makenzie University's Architecture
and Urban Planning Mosaico office.

12
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.170
It simply hasn't been cogitated.

13
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.080
Nobody's accepted to discuss the
project. The city council hasn't.

14
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.400
Nobody wanted to hear about it.
Every time it's been mentioned,

15
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.850
"No, this can't be done, we can't."
It's as if they're conducting

16
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.480
people who live in poor conditions
to give in and accept to leave.

17
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.170
And with no legal judgments.
It's a very diverse place.

18
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.910
Some people have lived here for many
years, they didn't wan't to leave

19
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.000
because this has been their lives.
Other people, their stories,

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.310
their memories, their children
and grandchildren have been born

21
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.970
and raised here. And other more
recent people have thought, "well,

22
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.400
this can be an opportunity to go
live somewhere else, maybe

23
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.170
in a public housing facility...

24
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.280
And then this is what happened.

25
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.620
Along the process,
these cracks have grown wider.

26
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.420
The City Council started
making offers one by one

27
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.310
and the whole thing cracked.

28
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.940
The resistance in the town house
became increasingly frail.

29
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.450
Two evictions have happened here:

30
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.110
the first one in 2011,

31
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.000
which was very sad,

32
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.620
imagine the scene: you're going
to move out and the City Council

33
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.110
says it would provide everything
for you. Then many trucks are sent

34
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.800
with agents for an "operation
clean-up" of the city.

35
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.400
Disguised.

36
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.200
And they grab your things like...

37
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.570
And the ones who stayed, who
wouldn't accepts such impositions,

38
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.080
who wanted to stay until the very
end, were evicted in 2013

39
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.740
by the police,
they blocked the street...

40
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.540
And it was a pretty violent process.

41
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.400
People had nowhere to go.

42
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.540
In this meeting we had,
we've said how absurd it is,

43
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.370
it shows that there's no dialogue

44
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.370
and there wouldn't have any

45
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.250
because they didn't want to have
it in 2006, with another project,

46
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.600
in the first place, so why
would they want to have it now?

47
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.050
And the governor has changed and I
want this to be clear: it's Kassab's

48
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.420
and Haddad's mandates. The last
eviction here happened

49
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.200
during Haddad's mandate and of the
Secretary of Culture Juca Ferreira.

50
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.880
Why is it not interesting for them?

51
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:44.000
Because poor people with
no purchasing power living here

52
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.600
won't value the region.
They'll trip it.

53
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.200
The investors of the building
today are clearly mentioned here.

54
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.770
There it is.
The image speaks for itself.

55
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.280
And then I ask... things
we can't know for sure,

56
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.820
so I'll make it a simple question:
would private financers of

57
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.140
the Rouanet Law be happy if
social housing had been built here?

58
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.970
which would devalue
the surrounding area.

59
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.200
How would they see it?
