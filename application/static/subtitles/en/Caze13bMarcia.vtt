00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.910
Puranga KarÃºka, that is, good
afternoon in Nheengatu language.

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.050
Nheengatu is not the
Mura people's primary language

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.340
but it's been revived

4
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:21.140
by many peoples,
including the Muras,

5
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:30.310
as a language of
resistance and political struggle

6
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.880
in the process of
reassembling indigenous peoples.

7
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.940
I come from Madeira River.

8
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.310
I was born in Porto Velho.
Today I still live there.

9
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.000
My identity is related to
living by Madeira River

10
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.800
and to this Mura ancestry,

11
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.370
because that river is
traditionally Mura

12
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.340
and also Munduruku territory.

13
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.480
Today, some other peoples
inhabit that region

14
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.020
and the Mura people live
in a southern area of Amazonas.

15
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.370
Porto Velho is a
completely whitened city

16
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.880
with a politically distorted
cartographic treatment, which

17
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.050
has erased indigenous
presence and settlements,

18
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.540
even though very many
indigenous peoples live there.

19
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.450
Many of them are being
silenced and wiped out.

20
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.220
In spite of that, we have
our dear maloca in Porto Velho

21
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.170
where there have been movements

22
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.200
for reviving the Mura culture
in the city.
