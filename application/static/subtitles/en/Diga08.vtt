00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
The first people to have settled in
the Bixiga neighborhood, obviously,

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.910
were indigenous. Then,
after the first massacre,

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.620
slaves came. They ran away from
slave auctions that used to

4
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:16.250
take place in a square where
today is Bandeira bus terminal.

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.970
The ones able to escape from the
auction came to the Bixiga region

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.740
because of its hilly terrain
and its many rivers.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
There are three rivers in this
region: Jacurá, Itororó and Saracura.

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.020
And the topography is rugged,
which makes it easier to use

9
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.480
independent spaces
for purposes of resistance,

10
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.310
and that's why they came here.

11
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.400
They've built quilombos here
and hardly were captured

12
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.080
thanks to those hideouts.

13
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.340
And that explains why today
in Bixiga we still have, for example,

14
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.540
the Vai-Vai samba school, candomble
temples and capoeira places there.

15
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.570
There's a negritude there
that makes you feel like

16
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.050
it's an ancestral thing whenever
you listen to Vai-Vai drums.

17
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.420
The Bixiga is not different
from any other region of the city.

18
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.220
The interest of the private sector
in the real estate market

19
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.020
is disguised as interest
of the public sector,

20
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.220
supported by mandates that more and
more make business out of the city

21
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.510
not interested in running
the city for the public good,

22
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.310
but in marketing the city
for private profit.

23
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.200
And the city is everything.
It's my body, your body,

24
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.050
the land. So they can... how is it
one markets the body? Transforms an

25
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.220
independent celebration
into an institutional celebration?

26
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.280
"Oh! Street carnival! It's free,
celebrated in street blocks,

27
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.050
how wonderful! Let's create
an event." So the City Council

28
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.820
comes in with money, make it
official, make a decree,

29
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.420
finds a sponsor and makes lots of
money, using the city to raise money.

30
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.200
Done. Street carnival is over.
It starts to become something else.
