00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.370
Well, speaking of the northern area,
the population that left Barra Funda

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.370
and the downtown areas started to
build other spaces, other territories:

4
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.800
Casa Verde, Peruche, and Brasilândia.
They're also territories of blacks.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.050
Another share of that population
went to the southern region,

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.050
to the Jabaquara neighbourhood,
another important territory of blacks.

7
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.450
Historically, the Jabaquara
quilombo was based on it...

8
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.620
And... well, what about it? It had
a very, very complicated history.

9
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.480
It's hard to recognize
the history of a place, isn't it?

10
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.340
There's a political purpose
in the construction of history.

11
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.800
Where today is Sítio da Ressaca House
was once the Jabaquara quilombo.

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.000
You may find it odd, "a quilombo
in the middle of the city?"

13
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.020
The Saracura quilombo
was located here too!

14
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.170
It was the first urban
quilombo of Sao Paulo.
