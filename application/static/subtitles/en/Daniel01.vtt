00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.620
- I think you just
gotta do your own thing...

2
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.340
- It's because
I'm gonna get nervous walking.

3
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.450
People living in squats

4
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.600
are in a position of high
social vulnerability.

5
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.510
I mean,

6
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.420
they're working-class families,

7
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.650
many of which came with that
surge of migration to Sao Paulo,

8
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.420
and they're low-income people.

9
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.020
So, what usually happens is that

10
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.420
they leave their land,
come to Sao Paulo willing for

11
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.800
wealth and success, and end up
becoming the city's working-class,

12
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.740
responsible for moving the
city forward, and even though,

13
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.680
they still lack sufficient
income to support themselves.

14
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.510
It's not reasonable for families
to support two, sometimes three

15
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.510
children and still pay the rent.

16
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.510
if you think about it,
it's very irrational.

17
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:23.250
So people can't afford
to live downtown

18
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.250
because it's so expensive.

19
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.540
And I believe the movements
for housing in the downtown area,

20
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.540
where all of the city's
infrastructure is,

22
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.620
are fundamental,

23
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.510
because these people get to
have access to things which

24
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.420
they wouldn't have
in the suburbs.

25
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.510
And I believe that
this springing up of

26
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.020
occupied places in the
downtown area, mainly,

27
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.650
is a movement of resistance
struggling against the dominant

28
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.020
economical and political hegemony.
