00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
"Invade" has
a semantic distinction.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.140
I'll give an example:
I'm in my room and you come

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.370
and expel me.

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.110
You're invading my space.
Now, in regard of the squat,

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.370
another example: nobody is in my
room for the past five, six years.

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.480
It's been empty and you
need a place to stay,

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.110
so you go in and stay there.

9
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.800
You're occupying an empty space.

10
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.280
That's what happens, see?

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.680
We occupy empty spaces
where nobody lives

12
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.850
anymore. And the media
uses this term, "invading"

13
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.710
because it's kind of a way

14
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.740
to criminalize, really.

15
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.400
It's different than "squatting",
which is a word that...

16
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.880
I didn't use to value this
kind of thing some six years ago,

17
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.140
but words matter a lot

18
00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.310
and the media absolutely
knows how to use them.

19
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.650
- Do you want to take a break?
- Ok.

20
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.420
- I'd like to have some water.

21
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.310
- There are only two more things
I wanna ask you, then we can close.

22
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.540
- Alright.
- I thought you must be tired...

23
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.510
-Forty-five. No...
forty-seven minutes.
