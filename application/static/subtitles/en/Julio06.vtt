00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
- Júlio makes way for us.
- Let's go.

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.000
- Ok, I'll be quiet, Júlio.

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.310
You do the talking.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.770
- You can talk too.

5
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.480
- So, the primary population
here was expelled after this area

6
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.740
started to be more appraised
in the real estate market.

7
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.800
By the end of the '60s,
when the metro station and

8
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.880
Itaú Bank were settled here,

9
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.280
this area started to be speculated
in the real estate market.

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.940
They see a park like this

11
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.850
and think it's only a nice
place to walk your dog, you know?

12
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.250
And nothing else. And it's
good for property appraisal,

13
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.740
because today, it's difficult to
get to live in a building close

14
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.110
to a green area,
an area of culture and art,

15
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.820
with a library.

16
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.140
They sell an idea of peace.

17
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.140
Sao Paulo is a big city

18
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.820
that lacks green areas like this.

19
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.740
If you take a look, there are
buildings everywhere around.

20
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.450
It seems like we're being
enclosed by speculation

21
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.110
to which the park
is only a leisure area.

23
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.370
- That only serves
as commercial value.

24
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.910
- And it's a park listed as heritage,
so they know there won't be very close

25
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.110
buildings on the surroundings.
- Yes.

26
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.020
And there's a postal card
of that house right there.

27
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.970
So they think "Oh! I live
close to a historical place".

28
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.970
But which story is it about?
