00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
What I believe to be alarming...

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.250
In 2013, when Arquitetura da
GentrificaÃ§Ã£o started,

3
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.050
we selected a case study of
public housing in the city centre

4
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.940
based on a public-private
partnership involving

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.400
the government of the state
of Sao Paulo, and the federal

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.370
and local governments,
together with the private party,

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.850
the construction companies.

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.770
Very briefly, what happened was:

9
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.770
The state and local governments
decreed the eviction of more

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.020
than 900 places
in the central area.

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.220
The people living in
those places were not told there

12
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.400
was going to be
an eviction action. They only

13
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.620
knew it cause some law firms that
spend the days looking for

14
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.110
disgrace on the official gazette
saw the decree and thought they'd

15
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.080
hand out flyers to those people
so that they'd go look for them

16
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.020
when they have to negotiate a
compensation for their expropriation.

17
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.370
And so those law folds went to
the places literally handing out

18
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.250
folders with institutional
presentations, telling people,

19
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.450
"you'll be ejected in some time.
You'd better look for help now

20
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.170
to get a higher amount of compensation

21
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170
for the action of expropriation."

22
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.250
And those people were shocked!

23
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.020
We have interviewed people who
got depressed. There was a lady

24
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.800
who was thinking about
renewing her house, like,

25
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.420
changing the roof, she didn't
know wether she could change

26
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.800
her sofa, her things, or not
because she might not stay there.

27
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.020
So she got depressed. We've heard
a lot of cases like this one.

28
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.220
And what's curious about it is
that people said, "I've never

29
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.820
imagined this was going to happen
to me! I have the property deed!"

30
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.420
So like, it's an illusion
to think that today,

31
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.620
in the neoliberal context,
we must only have a paper,

32
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.620
the property deed, and then we're
happily settled. It's not true.

33
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.340
Because the financial capital
is expansive.

34
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.710
Expansionist, right?

35
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.310
David Harvey talks about this,
he says the best way to

36
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.110
expand capital these days
is by fostering construction,

37
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.620
real estate development business,

38
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.510
because creative destruction
is proper of capitalism.

39
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.880
So there's a destruction
of what already exists.

40
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.850
80% of those properties

41
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.310
where being used.

42
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.680
They were not idle properties.

43
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.680
They were occupied.

44
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.200
So like, there's this need to
destroy what already exists

45
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.400
and build something else on
its place. And space is limited.

46
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.140
So more and more new things
will have to be destroyed

47
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.480
so that even newer things
can be built instead.

48
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.880
We have to realize

49
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.600
that it's a historical,

50
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600
systemic process.

51
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.370
And that these processes
are being developed.

52
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.850
There are newspaper reports
talking about hypergentrification

53
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.650
in London and Paris, for example.

54
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.600
People who have previously
gentrified an area are today

55
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.800
being expelled
by financial capital,

56
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.850
I mean, by an elite that
works in the financial market

57
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.650
and is now moving to
upper-middle-class areas,

58
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.340
paying a huge rent or buying
properties for exorbitant prices.

59
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.820
And the middle-upper class that
has previously gentrified the area

60
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.340
is now being kicked out.
