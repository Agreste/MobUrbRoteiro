Everybody thinks living in the
squat is the movement itself, but

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.880
whenever we have the opportunity
to say it we do: the occupation

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.570
is a tool of the movement.

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.110
It's not the movement itself.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.280
And there's a huge difference
between these two ideas, right?

6
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:27.680
Like, the tools of the movement
are: acts, dialogue with

7
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.280
the public departments, living
in the squat... so it's

8
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.200
a denunciation of the abandoned
buildings of the city.

9
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.370
The movement started
in the East Zone of Sao Paulo.

10
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.740
In groups, people discussed
housing issues, housing rights,

11
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.370
how to mobilize and
fight for their housing rights.

12
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.310
From those groups
the movement came to be.

13
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.140
So, today, the movement itself

14
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.740
is the families.
The families are the movement

15
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.280
and the occupation
is a tool of this movement

16
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.050
meant to expose the existing
real-state market corruption

17
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.770
in the city centre. The families
that came here five years ago

18
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.200
were looking for
a definitive place to live.

19
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.450
And the government hasn't
presented a solution

20
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.400
for the last five years.
So you can perceive the slowness

21
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.050
it takes to solve
this housing issues.

22
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.650
We hope to transform this building

23
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.540
into a low-cost housing,

24
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.650
but still nothing
is assured, you know?

25
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.570
A lot of people say, "it's good!
you've been here for five years."

26
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.970
Man, this is bad.

27
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.770
If we had stayed here
for the first month and then

28
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.910
in the second month the government
had provided us with housing,

29
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.820
you know? So I don't think being
in a squat for two years is good,

30
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.570
because it's not the purpose.
The purpose is to have our

31
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.280
permanent housing. Everybody
judges us for being here, for

32
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.770
living in someone else's property
and not paying anything. Actually,

33
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.220
we're only here to expose the
situation. We want a place to live.
