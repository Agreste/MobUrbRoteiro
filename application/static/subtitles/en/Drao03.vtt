00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Many were the policies of exclusion,

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.710
such as the 1908 city code...

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.940
What was it about?

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.620
It determined that men who sold
herbs and black women who sold treats

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.710
and other Afro-Brazilian products,

6
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.020
people who made a living from their trade,

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.220
would not be allowed to exist
in the downtown area anymore.

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.000
I mean, what?! If the streets were
an important space for socialization

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.370
and the city code regulates their use,
what happens to this population?

10
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.420
Well, folks try to get
as close as they can.

11
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.620
And the resistance movement is
nonstop in Bela Vista, Barra Funda

12
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.770
and many other territories of blacks
formed here in Sao Paulo.

13
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.680
Given that the street is vitally
important for the black population

14
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.220
specially when regarding culture,

15
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.480
diverse cultural expressions

16
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.600
manifested on many
downtown area streets,

17
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.770
such as the {\i1}Tambaquis{\i0}, 
the {\i1}Tiririca{\i0}, which is

18
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.540
a very regional capoeira
practice from Sao Paulo,

19
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.020
the {\i1}Batuque{\i0}, the {\i1}CoroaÃ§Ãµes
de Reis{\i0} festival, the {\i1}Samba Rural{\i0}

20
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.020
and many others.
