00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.170
Each downtown street, the
neighborhoods Bela Vista, Barra Funda...

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.850
are territories firstly resided
by black people who underwent

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.620
the gentrification process
around the 1700s, 1800s...

4
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.710
This square over here was
the former Largo do Rosário dos Pretos,

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.800
literally "The Blacks' Rosary Square",
where there were many houses,

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.280
all in this area. By strengthening
communal bonds, they got by.

7
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.220
Sao Paulo's
state-owned Bank is today

8
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.000
where once was the Nossa Senhora
do Rosario dos Homens Pretos Church,

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
an important brotherhood of the city.

10
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.200
It was built by slaves
during their free time.

11
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200
Each of them was raising money

12
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.600
to set up their brotherhood in here.
But you might ask me,

13
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.510
why brotherhood? Wasn't it a church?
Why all the contradiction?

14
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.450
They'd found a gap in the
system. Their primary aim

15
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.480
inside the brotherhood was to
maintain affective and communal bonds

16
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.050
to that segregated population.

17
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.880
The church ran until 1903.

18
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.170
Up to 1888, a great part of the
brotherhood's brothers and sisters

19
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.510
were manumitted, who'd
bought their freedom.

20
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.540
The brotherhoods also
played an important role

21
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.420
in the abolitionist
movements from 1850.

22
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.310
Not only this one, but also others,

23
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.310
such as the Remédios and the
Santa Efigênia churches.

24
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.940
Many of them united

25
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.510
to buy other black slaves' freedom.

26
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.280
From 1888, when the so called
abolition of slavery happened,

27
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.880
a new official
policy of segregation

28
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.400
was decreed by the state.

29
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.510
At the same time, the city
population is growing because

30
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.200
of the coffee surge. The city
later became the coffee metropolis.

31
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.540
In 1903, the mayor Antônio Prado

32
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.650
decreed this area
as an area of public use.

33
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.420
Now, if the city was growing, there
couldn't be any traces of relation

34
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.680
to the black population. The church's
headquarters was lost after this decree.

35
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.370
It was broke down in order to build
what today is the Antônio Prado Square.

36
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.850
The brotherhood received a small
amount and ended up disrupted.
