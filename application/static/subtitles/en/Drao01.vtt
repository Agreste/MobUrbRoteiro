00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
Every corner of Sao Paulo hides
a little bit of its history, right?

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.050
A little bit about
the population that here resided...

3
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.250
The gentrification process
have sharply affected the indigenous

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.650
and the black populations, for sure.

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.340
The indigenous population
was the first to undergo this

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.370
segregation and exclusion process,
thanks to the jesuits who arrived

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.620
at the coast.

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.480
In their way from Piratininga
to Sao Paulo, they've killed

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.170
lots of Indians, right? The
Guaianases, TupinambÃ¡s, Tamoios...

10
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.400
And so they arrived
in Sao Paulo around the 16th c.

11
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.970
The colonization...

12
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.880
The black population arrived
here in the 18th and 19th centuries.

13
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.650
The biggest contingence were people
who came to work in coffee plantations.

14
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.370
In that time, Sao Paulo
wasn't an influential city

15
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.570
comparing to Rio, for example.

16
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.450
It had 1/3 of Rio's population.

17
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.910
After the so called abolition of
slavery, in 1888, the black population

18
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.080
mostly made their living from trade.

19
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.910
Given that trade was mostly done
by the black population,

20
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.740
the streets were of high
importance to them,

21
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.280
being a valuable space for
sociability and connection.
