00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970
The owner wants to sell, the
City Council wants to buy...

2
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.050
They say they have the money,
the federal bank would finance,

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.480
but it won't happen. Why?

4
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:20.250
because there are people who
doesn't want low-income people

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.480
living in the central area, you
know? It's a segregation matter.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:33.710
It's a big issue. There's no way of
making it harmonious to give in

7
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.710
this right for low-income people.
And it's clear, you know?

8
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.050
This is what upsets me,

9
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.970
they don't wanna cave in for
a legitimate space to people

10
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.220
who pay taxes,
who are citizens.

11
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.510
And it's disappointing. But
at the same time it makes me

12
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.250
wanna go and say: "alright! So you
don't wanna do it? So we'll fight

13
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.820
for it, whether you like it
or not, cause the city is ours."

14
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.450
The city doesn't belong to
you or to me. It's not

15
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.000
that rich guy's or that beggar's.

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.220
It's everyone's.

17
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.220
And the city means conflict. If
you don't want to have conflicts

18
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.770
go live in a fief, where
you'll... I don't know,

19
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.370
play with sheep, fish.
Go live there.

20
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.970
City means conflict. If you
don't want to have then,

21
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.140
go to a fief.

22
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.710
I have to stay calm to say this,
but if I say it the way

23
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.450
I wanted to, I think you'd have
to edit 100% of the video.

24
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.280
Cause it's really a fucking shit.
You can cut the "fucking shit."

25
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.000
- Worst of all, the fief thing is
already happening, cause people go

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.310
live in those...
- Those gated communities, right?

27
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.020
Condos that have private banks
within, supermarkets, you know?

28
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.800
It's... like a fief.

30
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.480
Some architect scholars
call them, like, cocoons

31
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.050
or say they're like bell jars.

32
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.340
Depending of who you're talking to
they might use these names.

33
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.910
I particularly like
to call them fiefs,

34
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.420
cause fief was
an enclosed space with

35
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.940
exclusive internal markets
that people patronized.
