00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.880
The city centre is a blatant area

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.170
because it's where the
conflicts are out in the open.

3
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.940
In the city centre, people
of different social classes

4
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.820
live together. There's
a stark social inequality here,

5
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.250
right? And sometimes it makes
people strange to each other...

6
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.370
I mean, all the time.
And there's also this

7
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.740
issue of the real estate
appreciation rates getting

8
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.200
higher and higher in the centre

9
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.970
because of the growth of the city.

10
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.510
And the people living
in the city sprawl

11
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.880
can't really afford
the increasing costs,

12
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.600
so they try to find
cheaper places to live,

13
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.340
which most of the time
means the furthest areas

14
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.740
where there's no adequate
infrastructure yet.

15
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.000
Many people question why there
are inhabited watershed areas

16
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.140
or environmental protected areas
like GrajaÃº and Parelheiros.

17
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.600
These places
don't have an infrastructure

18
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.570
or a housing appreciation rate
yet, so people can afford them.

19
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.740
I don't know, I think
if the government provided

20
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.940
adequate conditions for those
people to live in the city centre,

21
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.850
with all its infrastructure,
of course they'd want to go!

22
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.400
They'd want to provide better
conditions for their children,

23
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.110
they'd want to have
a better quality of life.

24
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.740
When I hear criticism like
"oh! they're occupying protected

25
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.480
areas" I think there's
an obvious reason for that:

26
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.080
those people can't
afford to live elsewhere.

27
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.970
Before the struggle for housing,
there was a struggle for income.

28
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.880
It was prior to the struggle
for housing, right?

29
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.250
If people could afford
to live anywhere,

30
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.200
they'd live wherever they wanted,

31
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.250
but since they can't, they
go fight for their rights,

32
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.710
their housing rights,
in this case,

33
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.050
so that they might
be able to live in a proper,

34
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.050
affordable house.
