00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.620
It’s easier if you look at me,
so there’s no camera oppression.

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.620
Oh! right... I get it!

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.250
I’ll start my speech
a little forward in time...

4
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.000
I’ll start with this founding
myth regarding the bandeirantes,

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.500
which actually dates back
to the '20s in Sao Paulo.

6
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.250
In the '20s there was
a group of scholars

7
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.870
who were historians,
who were part of the elite,

8
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.600
and their task was to write
the history of this country.

9
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.650
If you take the period after
the abolition of slavery, you'd see

10
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.970
there's been a mass influx
of blacks who came to this city.

11
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.220
They've come from places like,
you know, the northeast...

13
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.940
And so, there were no more farms
for the blacks to live after

14
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.620
the abolition of slavery. The
landlords didn't want those slaves

15
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.940
anymore. So those folks had
to scatter. Blacks had to scatter

16
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.510
to get better living conditions.

17
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.650
Sao Paulo was an attractive city,

18
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.370
because in the beginning
of the 19th century,

19
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.200
it hosted the coffee boom, a new
economical cycle of the country.

20
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.850
And also in this period, there's
been an European migration process

21
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.370
fostered by
the Brazilian government,

22
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.20
that decided to give up our once
enslaved workforce because it was

23
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.540
then set free, and decided to invest
on immigrant workforce instead.

24
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.480
So this was the setting
of the city of Sao Paulo,

25
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.250
this atmosphere of
pursuing progress,

26
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.680
of pursuing a “whitening”
since the arrival of the immigrants.

27
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.910
They were mainly European,
specially Italian, right?
