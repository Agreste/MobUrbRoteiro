00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.450
The police has expelled people
from this space since the World Cup.

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.970
It had happened before, but
with the World Cup, it's started

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.310
to happen a lot more.
As I said, I've talked

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.850
to some street dwellers in that
time. Many of them cleared off

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.250
because they were afraid
that the armed forces would come

6
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.080
and take them away by force,

7
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.340
because they'd seen what was
happening, for example, at Rio

8
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.480
and Minas Gerais, in the newspapers.

9
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.600
So many of them left

10
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.170
and the ones who have stayed are
people in extreme situations,

11
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.820
as in drug dependence,
alcoholism, who had no conditions

12
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.910
to leave, for being very ill,

13
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.620
and so they had no reaction.
They ended up staying there.

14
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.080
And in this sense,
there's a contradiction.

15
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.650
There are many problems
in a conflicting area,

16
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.770
you can't do business with it.

17
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.940
So being that we have the
Pacifying Police Units, right?

18
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.940
The armed forces going up
the hill favela. Vera Teles,

19
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.310
a sociologist from USP,
talks about it.

20
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.620
She sais, "favelas
are areas of conflict,

21
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.370
but they're
very profitable places."

22
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.370
So what happens? The army
goes there, slaughter everyone,

23
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.570
fuck things up.
And then, who goes after them?

24
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.340
the telecoms go uphill,

25
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.340
banking agencies, SEBRAE,
the Brazilian Micro and Small

26
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.140
Enterprises' Support Service,

27
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.540
to transform the poor
into microentrepreneurs

28
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.710
so that they keep
producing products and services.

29
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.050
They have to produce something.
And clearly, there's not going

30
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.110
to be any improvement in
sanitation, in infra structure,

31
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.850
because poor people must remain as
the "cheap oil of the running gear."

32
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.000
So you can't give
them much better life conditions,

33
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.540
but you can make them
become microentrepreneurs,

34
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.620
who will, besides consuming,
also produce something.
